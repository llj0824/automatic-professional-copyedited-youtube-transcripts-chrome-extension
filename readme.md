    ### Debugging Different Components
    1. Popup/Side Panel
    - Files: `popup/popup.js`, `popup/popup.html`, `popup/popup.css`, `popup/storage_utils.js`, `popup/llm_api_utils.js`
    - To debug:
    1. Click the extension icon to open side panel
    2. Right-click and select "Inspect", set breakpoints

    2. Service Worker (`background/service_worker.js`)

    - To debug:
    1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
    2. Find your extension

    - To debug:
    1. Open DevTools on any YouTube page with active extension
    2. Go to Sources tab

II. Debugging unit and integration tests on Cursor
 1. when testing, run `npm run test:youtube_transcript_retrieval` to test the youtube_transcript_retrieval.js file.
 2. In Cursor to run debugger, set red dot on sidebar or `debugger;` in the code. Then `Run` tab -> `Start Debugging` refer to `launch.json` for configurations.

# TODOs
### backend system changes
0. add good/bad examples for generate highlights llm_api_utils.js
6. [website & database] make transcripts knowledge searchable
7. [show remaining balance] show remaining balance in the popup, atleast some visual indicator why no longer able to process new segmnets.
    -> note: chrome extension description should have section explaining this.
8. [prevent abuse] disable reprocessing if transcript alrdy exists
9. [feedback form] add @llj0824 twitter [x] handle for users to tweet me their feedback lol.


### Features
0. log raw & processed transcript in server/google sheets.
1. turn off extension on non-youtube sites
0. clear cache button -> existing transcript already exists.
1. autotrack transcript to where the video is at.
    -> note: actually what if i made the video skip towards where the transcript is at?


### Bugs
1. [top] for video, [AI Dev Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArptLpQiKfI&list=PLx5pnFXdPTRzWla0RaOxALTSTnVq53fKLï¼‰, the 3 and 4th processed page doesn't get stored...keeps showing up blank.
2. [top2] - highlights aren't being stored/retrieved per page. When i turn pages, the highlights don't change. 

1. if no processed transcripts sets segments to 0, even when there is a raw transcript for that page.
2. loading saved processed transcripts still not working
3. [failed to retrieve] [bug] failed to retrieve transcript from - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNJ93FfWVBY

[Resolved]
* [low priority, but should be easy] add some functionality to change font size of transcript.
* [top priority] add the title and description of the video to each pagination of transcript (so it knows speakers)
* [top priority] remove permission to read browsing history...
* [low priority] occasionally unable to automatically retrieve transcript -> initial data unavailable. Refresh page resolves. Replicate and implement a fix (possibly a retry mechanism).
	a. if captions is unable -> can't autoload
	b. if captions avaliable -> please try closing extension tab, and refreshing the page/video.
* [high priority] timestamps ~atleast 1 per 15 minutes, maybe 2-3 per page
* [remote server] use google drive/substack post the processed transcripts there and retrieve from there.
* [UI change][important and quick] make tab selection (raw vs processed) visually more obvious.
* [UIchange] make "process with LLM button more prominent" -> make it green or blue 
* unit and integration tests are only partially all passing. TBH i'll fix on a per need basis.
* change to use gpt-4o as default model, maybe even hide the model being used from the UI.
    - changed back to gpt-4o-mini after optimizing it
* add unit and LLM-as-judge to automaticaly test responses from LLM.
    - helps track regression in model performance
    - helps tracks effect of changes to prompt/system role.
    - [done] in llm_partition_optimization.test.js
* [refactoring] rename segments to "pages" or "pagination" it's much more intuitive.
* [quick] add gif tutorial/video of extension in action to readme/chrome extension (check ReadingAssist for example).  
* [quick] add chapter timestamps (if avaliable to context)
