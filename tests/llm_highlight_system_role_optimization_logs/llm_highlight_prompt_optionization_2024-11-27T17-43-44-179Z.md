🚀 Twitter Thread: Memecoins, Cults, and Generational Wealth 🌐

[22:02 -> 22:44]  
💡 "The current meme coin cycle feels like DeFi Summer 2020. Back then, people tracked every DeFi token listing. Now, Coinbase lists $PEPE, Robinhood relists $SOL, and meme coins are everywhere. History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes."  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
💡 "There are 2 ways to thrive in crypto: hyper-gambling on-chain or finding hardcore communities of believers. Meme coins split into short-term gambling and long-term community building. The next Dogecoin will come from the latter."  

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
💡 "Building a successful meme coin is about community. Think TikTok, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, and Twitter engagement. It’s not just a coin; it’s a movement."  

[25:08 -> 25:56]  
💡 "Want to spot the next cult-like meme coin? Look for projects at least 3 months old. True cults take 7-8 months to form, surviving 70%+ dips that flush out non-believers. Only the diamond hands remain."  

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
💡 "Metrics like diamond-handedness, wallet decentralization, and Gini coefficients reveal cult-like communities. But don’t ignore the vibe—artwork, videos, and Telegram chats matter too. Combine data with intuition."  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
💡 "The biggest winners in crypto often run for 1-2 years. The key? A passionate community. Memecoin metas may shift, but strong communities are non-negotiable for long-term success."  

[30:47 -> 31:37]  
💡 "I’m not selling any of my meme coin picks until Q4 2025. Why? Loyalty builds trust. Jumping from coin to coin feels like gambling. People want safety, not chaos."  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
💡 "My strategy: only buy during big dips, never during rips. I’d rather miss runners than buy tops. Patience pays off in crypto."  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
💡 "AI will disrupt everything, but defensible moats in tech are collapsing. In crypto, the future isn’t tech—it’s belief. BTC and cult meme coins thrive on community, not code."  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
💡 "Cult meme coins offer digital security through people. AI coins? They’re more like agent coins. Memes need simplicity—try explaining an AI meme to your grandma."  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
💡 "DeFi people love AI coins, but are they really memes? A cute dog is universal. An AI agent? That’s mid-curve thinking. Simplicity wins in the meme economy."

[26:17]  
⚡️ Controversial Point: Major "cult" meme coins for this cycle have already been created.

---

[30:47]  
⚡️ Controversial Point: Murad refuses to sell any of his meme coin picks until Q4 2025, regardless of performance.  
💬 Explanation: This rigid strategy goes against the conventional wisdom of adapting to market conditions and cutting losses when necessary. Murad prioritizes long-term conviction over short-term flexibility.

---

⚡️ Controversial Point: Cult meme coins provide "security in the digital world" through community, not technology.  
💬 Explanation: Murad asserts that the value of cult meme coins lies in their ability to foster trust and belonging, rather than technological innovation. This contrasts with the tech-centric focus of many crypto projects.

**[24:18 -> 24:31]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Navigating the dual nature of meme coins—short-term gambling versus long-term community building.  
✅ **Lesson Learned:** Success in meme coins lies in focusing on long-term community building rather than short-term speculation. Building strong, engaged communities through creative strategies like artwork, media, and social engagement is key to sustainability.

---

**[26:20 -> 26:49]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Identifying resilient communities that can withstand significant market downturns.  
✅ **Lesson Learned:** True "cult-like" communities emerge after enduring multiple 70%+ dips, as these events filter out non-believers and leave behind committed participants. This resilience is critical for future success.

---

**[28:07 -> 28:30]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Committing to a fixed list of meme coin picks in a rapidly evolving market.  
✅ **Lesson Learned:** While market trends shift, the key to long-term success is identifying coins with passionate communities and holding them for extended periods. Staying loyal to initial picks can provide stability and reduce the risk of chasing fleeting trends.

---

**[33:19 -> 33:36]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Avoiding the temptation to buy during market "rips" or hype cycles.  
✅ **Lesson Learned:** A disciplined approach of only buying during significant downturns helps avoid buying at market tops and ensures better entry points for long-term gains.

---

**[33:38 -> 37:35]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Competing with the rapid pace of technological innovation, particularly in AI and blockchain.  
✅ **Lesson Learned:** Technological advancements often erode competitive moats, making it difficult for projects to maintain long-term value. Instead, focusing on assets with strong community, belief, and cultural significance—like BTC and cult meme coins—provides a more enduring value proposition.

---

**[37:43 -> 38:16]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Keeping up with the constant evolution of AI-driven meme coins and their technological upgrades.  
✅ **Lesson Learned:** While AI coins may offer innovation, they lack the simplicity and relatability of traditional meme coins. Cult meme coins rooted in community and emotional connection offer a more secure and enduring appeal in the digital world.

---

**[38:24 -> 38:53]**  
🛑 **Challenge Faced:** Difficulty in "memeing" complex AI concepts to a broad audience.

Extracted Highlights:
[22:57 -> 23:16]  
🔎 Concept: Importance of Centralized Exchange (CEX) Listings  
📣 Explanation: Murad explains that when centralized exchanges list meme coins, it increases their availability and liquidity. This is important because many people still use these platforms instead of directly interacting with blockchain technology. Essentially, CEX listings make it easier for more people to buy and trade these coins.

---

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
🔎 Concept: Two Strategies for Success in Meme Coins  
📣 Explanation: Murad simplifies the meme coin space into two main strategies: "hyper-gambling on-chain" (short-term, high-risk trading) and "long-term community building" (creating strong, loyal communities like Dogecoin). He emphasizes that his focus is on the latter, which involves fostering belief and engagement within a community.

---

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
🔎 Concept: Building a Meme Coin Community  
📣 Explanation: Murad describes how building a successful meme coin involves creating a strong community through activities like social media growth, giveaways, competitions, and engaging content. The goal is to foster loyalty and excitement among supporters.

---

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
🔎 Concept: Identifying Strong Communities ("Cults")  
📣 Explanation: Murad explains that strong communities form when a coin survives multiple large price drops (70% or more). These dips filter out casual investors, leaving behind committed believers who are less likely to sell, even during significant price increases.

---

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
🔎 Concept: Metrics for Evaluating Meme Coin Communities

He also considers subjective factors like the vibe of Telegram or Discord chats and the quality of artwork and videos.

---

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
🔎 Concept: Holding Coins for Long-Term Success  
📣 Explanation: Murad explains that in past crypto cycles, the biggest winners were those who held their coins for one to two years. He believes that sticking with his picks, despite market trends, will yield better results than frequently switching investments.

---

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
🔎 Concept: Buying During Dips

---

[36:38 -> 37:35]  
🔎 Concept: The Future of Blockchain and AI  
📣 Explanation: Murad predicts that as AI and open-source technology advance, the cost of creating and maintaining blockchain projects will drop significantly. This will lead to fewer defensible technological advantages, making community and belief the primary drivers of value in crypto projects.

---

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
🔎 Concept: Security in Cult Meme Coins  
📣 Explanation: Murad argues that cult meme coins offer a sense of security in the digital world because their value is rooted in strong, loyal communities rather than rapidly changing technology. This makes them more stable compared to tech-driven projects.

🔎 Concept: Simplicity in Meme Coins  
📣 Explanation: Murad contrasts traditional meme coins (like dog-themed coins) with AI-related coins.

❓ **Question:** How does Murad view the long-term impact of AI on crypto and blockchain?

Extracted Highlights:
[24:18 -> 24:31]  
⚖️ Topic: Ethical implications of meme coin investments  
🌍 Implication: Murad highlights the dual nature of meme coin investments—short-term gambling versus long-term community building. The ethical dilemma arises from promoting speculative gambling, which can lead to financial harm for inexperienced investors, versus fostering genuine communities that may provide value and stability. This raises questions about the responsibility of influencers and platforms in guiding their audiences.

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
⚖️ Topic: AI's impact on blockchain and technological innovation  
🌍 Implication: Murad discusses how AI advancements are reducing the cost and barriers to creating blockchain projects, potentially eroding defensible moats and diminishing the value of technological exclusivity. This trend could democratize access but also destabilize existing projects, raising concerns about sustainability and the ethical use of AI in open-source ecosystems.

[37:43 -> 38:24]  
⚖️ Topic: Security and trust in digital communities versus AI-driven projects  
🌍 Implication: Murad contrasts the perceived stability of cult-like meme coin communities with the rapid evolution of AI-driven projects. He suggests that the constant innovation in AI creates insecurity, while meme coins offer a sense of digital belonging. This highlights a social dilemma: should the focus be on fostering human-centric communities or embracing cutting-edge, albeit transient, technological advancements?

[38:24 -> 38:53]  
⚖️ Topic: Accessibility and relatability of digital assets  
🌍 Implication: Murad critiques the complexity of AI-driven coins, arguing that their lack of relatability may hinder their adoption compared to simpler, more universally understood meme coins. This raises questions about inclusivity in the crypto space and whether technological advancements are alienating broader audiences in favor of niche, tech-savvy groups.
