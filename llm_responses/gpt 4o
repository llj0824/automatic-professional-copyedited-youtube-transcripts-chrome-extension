Joe Rogan:
Joe Rogan podcast, check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

[00:11 -> 00:14]
Joe Rogan:
All right, we're rolling. Good to see you, sir. Here we go.

[00:16 -> 00:29]
Joe Rogan:
One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get a copyright strike, and we don't want to get the episode taken down.

[00:32 -> 00:34]
Joe Rogan:
But it was the episode of you when you were on The View.

[00:34 -> 00:38]
Joe Rogan:
I think it was 2015 or 2016, like when you were running for president, right?

[00:41 -> 00:44]
Joe Rogan:
And you got introduced as our friend Donald Trump.

[00:44 -> 00:46]
Donald Trump:
That's right.

[00:46 -> 00:48]
Joe Rogan:
Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss.

[00:48 -> 00:51]
Joe Rogan:
Joy Behar gives you a big hug. Barbara Walters gives you a big hug.

[00:51 -> 00:53]
Joe Rogan:
They all loved you.

[00:53 -> 00:56]
Joe Rogan:
They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially.

[00:56 -> 01:00]
Joe Rogan:
They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering.

[01:00 -> 01:14]
Joe Rogan:
And then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working against you. But there's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically.

[01:14 -> 01:22]
Joe Rogan:
When you see those same people in the past very favorable to you, like Oprah, when you were on Oprah's show, she was encouraging you.

[01:22 -> 01:39]
Donald Trump:
Last week, I did one of her last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday. That was a big deal, being on Oprah's show, the last one. And I was like one of the last shows in that final week. And I said, boy, we've come a long way since that.

[01:39 -> 01:56]
Joe Rogan:
What was it like?

[01:56 -> 02:02]
Donald Trump:
Well, the concept, it was really like two different lives. You know, I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons.

[02:02 -> 02:09]
Donald Trump:
We had actually 14 seasons over 12 years. They canceled The Apprentice when you were running for president, correct?

[02:09 -> 02:12]
Joe Rogan:
No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it.

[02:12 -> 02:19]
Donald Trump:
I was involved in that, and I had enough of it. We did great. It was doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me.

[02:19 -> 02:27]
Donald Trump:
They said, we're going to give you a contract. They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy, and they wanted to extend the contract.

[02:27 -> 02:33]
Donald Trump:
Mark said, you're crazy, don't run, don't run. Nobody gives up prime time.

[02:33 -> 02:37]
Donald Trump:
They said, you know, it's one of those little things, which is probably true. Nobody gives up prime time for running.

[02:37 -> 02:46]
Donald Trump:
Well, for running against 20-some people, you know, it turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians. They said, who would do this? I mean, it's a long shot.

[02:46 -> 02:54]
Donald Trump:
Actually, the heads of NBC came over, Paul Telegdy, all the top people came over to see me, trying to talk me out of it because they wanted to have me extend.

[02:54 -> 03:03]
Donald Trump:
The Apprentice was doing well. So it was 14 seasons, 12 years. We had one or two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show.

[03:03 -> 03:16]
Donald Trump:
And I said, you know, I want to do this. What happened is, previously, like three years, four years before that, they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney, and somehow they put me in a poll, and I blew everybody away.

[03:16 -> 03:26]
Donald Trump:
I blew him away, which isn't that hard, frankly, but I blew everybody away. And I said, that's interesting because I never really gave it that much real thought. I thought about it but never real thought.

[03:26 -> 03:36]
Donald Trump:
But I saw these polls were very good, and so I was thinking about doing it then, but I had a contract with The Apprentice. Plus, I was building two big buildings at the time, and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly.

[03:36 -> 03:45]
Donald Trump:
And it was one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that. I got them done. I had some very good successes.

[03:45 -> 03:58]
Donald Trump:
And I came on, and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster, and I ran, and I won against Hillary. It was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you're right.

[03:58 -> 04:13]
Donald Trump:
The View, I was on The View many, many times, and they loved me just the way people would talk. I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you, there were always feuds and stuff like that.

[04:13 -> 04:24]
Donald Trump:
But the reality was the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president. It was very coordinated, and some people are catching on to that now. There's a lot of people that were longtime Democrats like Elon and Bill Maher.

[04:24 -> 04:37]
Donald Trump:
And all these different very intelligent people, and they support me now. Bill supports me. He's been very supportive too. What this is what I wanted to ask you, what was it like when you actually got in?

[04:37 -> 04:47]
Joe Rogan:
Nobody really can prepare you for that. When you're running for president, you don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office. What did you think it was going to be like in office or when you decided to run?

[04:47 -> 04:56]
Donald Trump:
No, when you got in.

[04:56 -> 05:00]
Joe Rogan:
When I was in, so when I was in and won and was in the White House essentially.

[05:00 -> 05:06]
Donald Trump:
Well, first of all, it was very surreal. You know, it's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal.

[05:06 -> 05:12]
Donald Trump:
When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear.

[05:12 -> 05:22]
Donald Trump:
You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, ears bleed a lot. Bleed anyway. So, and I was thinking the other day, when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened.

[05:22 -> 05:35]
Donald Trump:
I said I wasn't hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience. Okay, and what's day one like? You win, you get inaugurated. Holy, I'm the president.

[05:35 -> 05:49]
Donald Trump:
Yeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I just built a building on Pennsylvania Avenue, you know, the hotel, the old post office. We called it Trump National Hotel, and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria.

[05:49 -> 06:04]
Donald Trump:
And it was a wonderful thing, but I'm driving down, I'm passing the hotel. You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military. You know, it was a major thing. I got off really the first time I used Air Force One, landed, and we're coming down.

[06:04 -> 06:18]
Donald Trump:
And they were, it was very, I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. You know, normally you're used to going one way, and all of a sudden you're going the other way.

[06:18 -> 06:30]
Donald Trump:
The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out, and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, that's a little bit dangerous, right? I mean, when you watch like Kennedy and some others, right?

[06:30 -> 06:45]
Donald Trump:
But I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy. And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do, and Melania got out with her beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple.

[06:45 -> 07:00]
Donald Trump:
It was, people loved it. And Barron, and we're walking down the street. But where it really got amazing, we get to the White House, and now it's a little bit before dark, beautiful.

[07:00 -> 07:14]
Donald Trump:
And we went up to the president's quarters, they call them the presidential quarters, and I'm standing in this beautiful hallway. You know, it's funny, nobody ever talks about the White House as being beautiful inside.

[07:14 -> 07:27]
Donald Trump:
You know, you think it's going to be, everything's going to be all metal doors and stuff. It's not. It's so beautiful. I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide. The ceiling heights are, it's so beautiful.

[07:27 -> 07:45]
Donald Trump:
But I was standing there, and I said to the guys, I want to see the Lincoln bedroom. I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom. I'd heard about the Lincoln bedroom, and I was standing with my wife. I said, do you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom.

[07:45 -> 08:03]
Donald Trump:
I mean, it was like, it was amazing because it's, look, if you love the country, but here you are, the Lincoln bedroom, and the bed, you know, he was very tall. He was 6'6", which then would be like, like Barron, right? Would be like Barron Trump. He's 6'9".

[08:03 -> 08:18]
Donald Trump:
But 6'6", he was very tall then. On top of that, he wore, there it is, he wore that, yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed, because very, you know, people were shorter then. You see some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground, actually.

[08:18 -> 08:35]
Donald Trump:
But he had the long bed, and they had, you had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address. And this is the original, and I'm looking, and I just looked around.

[08:35 -> 08:48]
Donald Trump:
I said, do you believe this? Because I was never a politician. First of all, even if you were a politician, but I was never a politician. It just, I sort of just started, right? And all of a sudden, I'm standing in the White House, and it was very, very surreal.

[08:48 -> 09:03]
Donald Trump:
That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. You know, to me, when I looked at the bed, and the bed, you could see, was a little bit longer, had to be a little bit longer. He lost his son, and they suffered, the two of them suffered from melancholia.

[09:03 -> 09:18]
Donald Trump:
They didn't call it depression, they called it melancholia, and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy, and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. And on top of that, they lost their son, whose name was Tad.

[09:18 -> 09:35]
Donald Trump:
And it was just seeing it in the little picture, a little tiny picture, I mean, you can't see the details there, a little tiny everything. There was a little tiny picture of Tad, who he lost, and it was devastating.

[09:35 -> 09:52]
Donald Trump:
And he was, you know, he was in a war, he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row, and he was getting like a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff.

[09:52 -> 10:06]
Donald Trump:
But like, I went to a UFC fight, and it was a champion who was 14-1 about a year ago. You would know the names, 14-1, and the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like almost just an average fighter, lost numerous times.

[10:06 -> 10:18]
Donald Trump:
But he beat this one guy, so I said, okay, I really don't know who you're talking about. I will figure it out, okay, but about a year ago. But the point is that he lost, he wasn't nearly the fighter as the, but the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten.

[10:18 -> 10:31]
Donald Trump:
He's the only guy that beat the champ like five years before, and I said, I'll take the guy that won the other fight, and that's what happened. He beat him a second time. Sometimes psychological advantage is this crazy thing.

[10:31 -> 10:54]
Donald Trump:
Lincoln had a, I don't know, I've never read this, I heard it from people in the White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of the White House. But Lincoln had the yips about, in a way, as the golfers would say, he had a phobia about Robert E. Lee.

[10:54 -> 11:12]
Donald Trump:
He said, I can't beat Robert because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of, you know, they tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, no, I have to be with my state. You know, the state was his whole thing, and he went to the South.

[11:12 -> 11:30]
Donald Trump:
And he was, I've had generals tell me, we have some great generals, the real generals, not the ones you see on television, the ones that beat ISIS with me. We defeated ISIS in record time. It was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks.

[11:30 -> 11:42]
Donald Trump:
These are great generals, these are tough guys, these are not woke guys, but their favorite general in terms of genius was Robert E. Lee. Strategically, he took a war that should have been over in a few days, and it was, you know, years of hell, a vicious war.

[11:42 -> 12:08]
Donald Trump:
And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. You know, I ran, I ran a number of months before I won. I probably, I guess if you figured it out, it would be a year, something like that. So I had never run for office, and I did well.

[12:08 -> 12:22]
Donald Trump:
I mean, I went into debates, we had 18 people, including me, and then slowly but surely, they started to disappear. We had debates, good debates. Everyone's aware of all this stuff, but what I want to get to is like, what was the experience once you got inside?

[12:22 -> 12:38]
Joe Rogan:
What did you think it was going to be like in terms of your ability to govern? Like, this is your first experience governing anything. You've never been a governor, you've never been a mayor, private stuff, business, but now all of a sudden you're inside the White House.

[12:38 -> 12:52]
Donald Trump:
The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed, it was really a hallowed place to me. It was beyond, to me, that was the experience. It was a surreal experience, and then with time, that wears off.

[12:52 -> 13:07]
Donald Trump:
With time, it becomes, you know, your place where you stay. And I was doing a lot of, I had two things that I really focused on: governing the country and survival. Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden, I mean, they came down.

[13:07 -> 13:27]
Donald Trump:
I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And you see that, I mean, you see, we're in the Washington Post very early on, they said, well, now the impeachment stuff starts, and it did. I mean, it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation.

[13:27 -> 13:40]
Donald Trump:
I had a combination. Most people don't have the survival. They get in. What did you expect, though, in terms of once you got inside, you had to appoint all these people? Like, how many appointments did you have to make?

[13:40 -> 13:54]
Joe Rogan:
You have, you actually have 10,000 appointments. Now they're different, you know, you have big ones, and then they appoint 100 people and 200 people, but the president really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments.

[13:54 -> 14:08]
Donald Trump:
So you'll appoint a Secretary of State, and he or she will appoint a lot of people. So it's a lot, but in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100, but they're big ones: Treasury, State, Military.

[14:08 -> 14:24]
Joe Rogan:
And how did you know who to appoint?

[14:24 -> 14:32]
Donald Trump:
Well, I didn't. I had no experience. You have to understand, I was there 17 times in Washington, and I never stayed over, according to the press, which I think is probably right.

[14:32 -> 14:38]
Donald Trump:
Over the years, I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying this place is gorgeous, but you know, I don't know anybody.

[14:38 -> 14:54]
Donald Trump:
It's like you go to certain areas and other areas, they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great right now. We've got to fix it. We've got to make it better. Very dangerous place, very badly maintained place. We're going to make it great. We're going to make it better. We're going to bring it back.

[14:54 -> 14:58]
Donald Trump:
But I wasn't a Washington guy. I was...

So, no, when you got in.

[05:00 -> 05:03]
Joe Rogan:
When I was in, so when I was in and won and was in the White House essentially.

[05:03 -> 05:06]
Donald Trump:
Well, first of all, it was very surreal.

[05:06 -> 05:10]
Donald Trump:
You know, it's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal.

[05:10 -> 05:15]
Donald Trump:
When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit.

[05:15 -> 05:22]

Okay, and what's day one like? You win, you get inaugurated. Holy, I'm the president.

I got off really the first time I used Air Force One, landed, and we're coming down. And they were, it was very, I mean, it was incredible.

[06:12 -> 06:18]
Donald Trump:
And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. You know, normally you're used to going one way, and all of a sudden you're going the other way.

[06:18 -> 06:28]
Donald Trump:
The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, that's a little bit dangerous, right?

[06:28 -> 06:35]
Donald Trump:
I mean, when you watch like Kennedy and some others, right? But I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.

[06:35 -> 06:50]
Donald Trump:
And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do, and Melania got out with her beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. People loved it.

[06:50 -> 07:03]
Donald Trump:
And Barron, and we're walking down the street. But where it really got amazing, we get to the White House, and now it's a little bit before dark, beautiful.

[07:03 -> 07:14]
Donald Trump:
And we went up to the president's quarters, they call them the presidential quarters, and I'm standing in this beautiful hallway.

[07:14 -> 07:22]
Donald Trump:
You know, it's funny, nobody ever talks about the White House as being beautiful inside. You know, you think it's going to be, everything's going to be all metal doors and stuff. It's not, it's so beautiful.

[07:22 -> 07:35]
Donald Trump:
I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide, the ceiling heights are, it's so beautiful. But I was standing there, and I said to the guys, I want to see the Lincoln bedroom.

[07:35 -> 07:47]
Donald Trump:
I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom. I'd heard about the Lincoln bedroom, and I was standing with my wife. I said, do you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom. I mean, it was like, it was amazing.

[07:47 -> 08:03]
Donald Trump:
Because it's, look, if you love the country, but here you are, the Lincoln bedroom, and the bed, you know, he was very tall. He was 6'6", which then would be like, like Barron, right? Would be like Barron Trump, he's 6'9".

[08:03 -> 08:13]
Donald Trump:
But 6'6", he was very tall then. On top of that, he wore, there it is, he wore that, yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed, because very, you know, people were shorter then.

[08:13 -> 08:28]
Donald Trump:
You see some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground, actually. But he had the long bed, and they had, you had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address.

[08:28 -> 08:40]
Donald Trump:
And this is the original, and I'm looking, and I just looked around, I said, do you believe this? Because I was never a politician. First of all, even if you were a politician, but I was never a politician.

[08:40 -> 08:54]
Donald Trump:
I sort of just started, right? And all of a sudden, I'm standing in the White House, and it was very, very surreal. That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is, you know, to me.

[08:54 -> 09:07]
Donald Trump:
When I looked at the bed, and the bed, you could see, was a little bit longer, had to be a little bit longer. He lost his son, and they suffered, the two of them suffered from melancholia.

[09:07 -> 09:18]
Donald Trump:
They didn't call it depression, they called it melancholia, and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy, and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him.

[09:18 -> 09:29]
Donald Trump:
And on top of that, they lost their son, whose name was Tad. Tad. And it was just seeing it in the little picture, a little tiny picture, I mean, you can't see the details there.

[09:29 -> 09:42]
Donald Trump:
Little tiny everything, the W was a little tiny picture of Tad, who he lost, and it was devastating. And he was, you know, he was a, look, he was in a war, he was, he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee.

[09:42 -> 09:56]
Donald Trump:
Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row, and he was getting like a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff, but like I went to a UFC fight, and it was a champion who was 14-1 about a year ago.

[09:56 -> 10:11]
Donald Trump:
You would know the names, 14-1, and the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like almost just an average fighter, lost numerous times, but he beat this one guy.

[10:11 -> 10:18]
Donald Trump:
So I said, okay, I really don't know who you're talking about. I will figure it out, okay, but about a year ago.

[10:18 -> 10:27]
Donald Trump:
But the point is that he lost, he wasn't nearly the fighter as the, but the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten, he's the only guy that beat the champ like five years before.

[10:27 -> 10:42]
Donald Trump:
And I said, I'll take the guy that won the other fight, and that's what happened. He beat him a second time. Sometimes psychological advantage is this crazy thing. Lincoln had a, I don't know, I've never read this.

[10:42 -> 10:56]
Donald Trump:
I heard it from people in the White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of the White House, but Lincoln had the yips about, in a way, as the golfers would say, he had a phobia about Robert E. Lee.

[10:56 -> 11:12]
Donald Trump:
He said, I can't beat Robert because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of, you know, they tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, no, I have to be with my state.

[11:12 -> 11:22]
Donald Trump:
You know, the state was his whole thing, and he went to the South, and he was, I've had generals tell me, we have some great generals, the real generals, not the ones you see on television.

[11:22 -> 11:35]
Donald Trump:
The ones that beat ISIS with me, we defeated ISIS in record time. It was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals, these are tough guys, these are not woke guys.

[11:35 -> 11:48]
Donald Trump:
But their favorite general in terms of genius was Robert E. Lee. Strategically, he took a war that should have been over in a few days, and it was, you know, years of hell, a vicious war.

[11:48 -> 12:04]
Donald Trump:
And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. You know, I ran, I ran a number of months before I won. I probably, I guess if you figured max it out, it would be a year, something like that.

[12:04 -> 12:13]
Donald Trump:
So I had never run for office, and I did well. I mean, I went into debates, we had 18 people including me, and then slowly but surely they started to disappear.

[12:13 -> 12:27]
Donald Trump:
We had debates, good debates. Everyone's aware of all this stuff, but what I want to get to is like, what was the experience once you got inside? Like, what did you think it was going to be like in terms of your ability to govern?

[12:27 -> 12:40]
Joe Rogan:
Like, this is your first experience governing anything. You've never been a governor, you've never been a mayor, private stuff, business, but now all of a sudden you're inside the White House.

[12:40 -> 12:52]
Donald Trump:
The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed, it was really a hallowed place to me. It was beyond, to me, that was the experience. It was a surreal experience.

[12:52 -> 13:05]
Donald Trump:
And then with time, that wears off. With time, it becomes, you know, your place where you stay. And I was doing a lot of, I had two things that I really focused on: governing the country and survival.

[13:05 -> 13:22]
Donald Trump:
Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden, I mean, they came down. I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And you see that, I mean, you see, we're in the Washington Post very early on.

[13:22 -> 13:36]
Donald Trump:
They said, well, now the impeachment stuff starts, and it did. I mean, it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation. I had a combination most people don't have the survival, they get in.

[13:36 -> 13:46]
Joe Rogan:
What did you expect, though, in terms of like once you got inside, you had to appoint all these people? Like, how many appointments did you have to make?

[13:46 -> 13:54]
Donald Trump:
You have, you actually have 10,000 appointments. Now they're different, you know, you have big ones, and then they appoint 100 people and 200 people.

[13:54 -> 14:03]
Donald Trump:
But the president really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. So you'll appoint a Secretary of State, and he or she will appoint a lot of people.

[14:03 -> 14:10]
Donald Trump:
So it's a lot, but in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100, but they're big ones: Treasury, State, Military.

[14:10 -> 14:24]
Joe Rogan:
And how did you know who to appoint?

[14:24 -> 14:32]
Donald Trump:
Well, I didn't. I had no experience. You have to understand, I was there 17 times in Washington, and I never stayed over, according to the press, which I think is probably right.

[14:32 -> 14:38]
Donald Trump:
Over the years, I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying this place is gorgeous, but you know, I don't know anybody.

[14:38 -> 14:47]
Donald Trump:
It's like you go to certain areas and other areas, they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great right now. We've got to fix it, we've got to make it better.

[14:47 -> 14:54]
Donald Trump:
Very dangerous place, very badly maintained place. We're going to make it great, we're going to make it better, we're going to bring it back. But I wasn't a Washington guy.

## Attempt 1: note this is going over the 15 minute raw transcript. It may be hallucinating.

[00:01 -> 00:07]
Joe Rogan:
Joe Rogan podcast, check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

[00:11 -> 00:14]
Joe Rogan:
All right, we're rolling. Good to see you, sir.

[00:16 -> 00:29]
Joe Rogan:
Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get a copyright strike, and we don't want to get the episode taken down.

[00:32 -> 00:53]
Joe Rogan:
But it was the episode of you when you were on The View, I think it was 2015 or 2016, like when you were running for president, right? And you got introduced as our friend Donald Trump. Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss, Joy Behar gives you a big hug, Barbara Walters gives you a big hug. They all loved you.

[00:56 -> 01:16]
Joe Rogan:
They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering, and then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working against you.

[01:19 -> 01:27]
Joe Rogan:
But there's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically.

[01:30 -> 01:41]
Joe Rogan:
When you see those same people in the past very favorable to you, like Oprah when you were on Oprah's show, she was encouraging you. Last week, I did one of our last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday. That was a big deal, being on Oprah's show.

[01:43 -> 01:47]
Joe Rogan:
The last one, and I was like one of the last shows in that final week, and I said, "Boy, we've come a long way since then."

[01:50 -> 02:02]
Donald Trump:
What was it like? Well, the concept, it was really like two different lives. You know, I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons, actually 14 seasons, 12 years.

[02:05 -> 02:14]
Donald Trump:
They canceled The Apprentice when I was running for president, correct? No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that, and I had enough of it. We did great, it was doing great.

[02:16 -> 02:31]
Donald Trump:
But they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me. They said, "We're going to give you a contract." They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy, and they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, "You're crazy, don't run, don't run. Nobody gives up prime time."

[02:33 -> 02:41]
Donald Trump:
They said, "You know, it's one of those little things," which is probably true. Nobody gives up prime time for running against 20-some people. It turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians.

[02:46 -> 03:03]
Donald Trump:
They said, "Who would do this? I mean, it's a long shot." Actually, the heads of NBC came over, Paul Telegdy, all the top people came over to see me, trying to talk me out of it because they wanted to have me extend The Apprentice. It was doing well.

[03:06 -> 03:16]
Donald Trump:
So it was 14 seasons, 12 years. We had one or two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show, and I said, "You know, I want to do this."

[03:19 -> 03:36]
Donald Trump:
What happened is, previously, like three years, four years before that, they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney, and somehow they put me in a poll, and I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn't that hard, frankly, but I blew everybody away.

[03:39 -> 03:45]
Donald Trump:
And I said, "That's interesting," because I never really gave it that much real thought. I thought about it but never real thought.

[03:47 -> 04:04]
Donald Trump:
But I saw these polls were very good, and so I was thinking about doing it then, but I had a contract with The Apprentice. Plus, I was building two big buildings at the time, and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly.

[04:07 -> 04:27]
Donald Trump:
And it was one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that, I got them done, I had some very good successes, and I came on, and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster.

[04:30 -> 04:42]
Donald Trump:
And I ran, and I won against Hillary. It was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you're right, The View, I was on The View many, many times, and they loved me.

[04:45 -> 05:00]
Donald Trump:
Just the way people would talk, I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you, there were always feuds and stuff like that. But the reality was, the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president.

[05:03 -> 05:27]
Donald Trump:
It was very coordinated, and some people are catching on to that now. There's a lot of people that were longtime Democrats, like Elon and Bill Maher, and all these different very intelligent people, and they support me now. Bill supports me, he's been very supportive too.

[05:30 -> 05:50]
Joe Rogan:
What was it like when you actually got in? Nobody really can prepare you for that. When you're running for president, you don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office. What did you think it was going to be like in office?

[05:52 -> 06:00]
Joe Rogan:
Or when you decided to run? No, when you got in.

[06:03 -> 06:12]
Donald Trump:
So when I was in and won and was in the White House, essentially, well, first of all, it was very surreal.

[06:15 -> 06:37]
Donald Trump:
You know, it's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear.

[06:40 -> 06:56]
Donald Trump:
You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, ears bleed a lot. Bleed anyway. So, and I was thinking the other day, when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened.

[06:59 -> 07:12]
Donald Trump:
I said I wasn't hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience.

[07:15 -> 07:48]
Joe Rogan:
Okay, and what's day one like? You win, you get inaugurated. Holy, I'm the president.

[07:51 -> 08:00]
Donald Trump:
Yeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I just built a building on Pennsylvania Avenue, you know, the hotel, the old post office. We called it Trump National Hotel.

[08:03 -> 08:18]
Donald Trump:
And we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria, and it was a wonderful thing. But I'm driving down, I'm passing the hotel. You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military. You know, it was a major thing.

[08:21 -> 08:35]
Donald Trump:
I got off, really, the first time I used Air Force One, landed, and we're coming down. And it was very, I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction.

[08:38 -> 08:50]
Donald Trump:
You know, normally you're used to going one way, and all of a sudden you're going the other way. The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out and wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, that's a little bit dangerous, right?

[08:53 -> 09:00]
Donald Trump:
I mean, when you watch like Kennedy and some others, right? But I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.

[09:03 -> 09:20]
Donald Trump:
And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do, and Melania got out with her beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. People loved it.

I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide, the ceiling heights are, it's so beautiful. But I was standing there, and I said to the guys, "I want to see the Lincoln bedroom." I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom.

Donald Trump:
And he was getting like a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff. But like, I went to a UFC fight, and it was a champion who was 14-1 about a year ago. You would know the names, 14-1.
