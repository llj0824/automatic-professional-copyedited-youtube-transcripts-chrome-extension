[22:02 -> 22:44]  
Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely insane. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.  

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that's going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
CEX listings are definitely important because there are still many people around the world who rely on centralized exchanges rather than interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings enhance distribution and liquidity. So, they remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused during 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve also mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my focus is on staying disciplined and continuing to refine my strategies. I’m actively engaging with the community, particularly in Telegram chats, and ensuring that everyone is aligned with the broader vision. It’s about maintaining momentum and preparing for what’s ahead. I believe that the groundwork we’re laying now will pay off significantly in the future.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the believers—those who stay, buy more, and are truly committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These individuals are not going to sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to identify what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, I personally need to connect with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. By combining all of these factors, you can build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]  
Host:  
Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be difficult for you to change your mind at this stage. If you wanted to add a new coin to your list, how would you go about it? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell and replace it with another? Have you considered this? It’s something I’ve been thinking about, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. However, if you study past cycles, you’ll notice that the big winners tend to perform well for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think we can agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there must be a very, very passionate community behind the coin. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m completely fine with that. From my experience with past cycles, the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought...  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
...coins and held them for a year, sometimes even two years. That’s the approach I’ve decided to take with my portfolio. Despite all the recent metas, I still believe the coins I’ve chosen will end up being some of the biggest winners, and I’m sticking to that. That’s my stance for now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader often says, is the ability to change your mind. Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if your thesis is invalidated for any reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m holding these until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Murad:  
AI memes are interesting, but I think they’re still in their infancy. I’m not saying they won’t have their moment, but for now, I’m not convinced they align with my strategy. I’m focused on coins that I believe have a strong narrative and staying power. AI memes might be something to revisit in the future, but they’re not on my radar at the moment.

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just a pump for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was responsible for creating the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 gets released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops. It’s a constant cycle, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would argue they’re more like AI agent coins—something entirely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I’d meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple—like, "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking, but it feels less intuitive.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people are really into the AI coins.

What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that’s going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
Yeah, I mean, CEX listings are significant because there are still many people globally who rely on centralized exchanges rather than interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings enhance distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve also mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my primary focus is on building and maintaining the community. Telegram is a big part of that, as it’s where a lot of the discussions and coordination happen. I’m also keeping an eye on market trends and refining strategies. At this stage, it’s about staying disciplined, ensuring that the groundwork we’ve laid is solid, and preparing for what’s to come.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the true believers—those who stay, buy more, and are genuinely committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These individuals won’t sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to identify what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, I personally need to connect with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a distinct vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. By combining all of these factors, you can build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]  
Host:  
Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be difficult for you to change your mind now. If you wanted to add a new coin to the list, what would you do? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell and replace it with another? Have you thought about this? It’s something that’s been on my mind, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. But if you study past cycles, the big winners tend to run for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think you’d agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there needs to be a very, very passionate community behind it. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m totally fine with that. For me, I know from past cycles that the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought coins and held them for a year, even two years.  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
That’s what I’ve decided to do with my portfolio. Even after all the recent metas, I still think my coins are going to end up being some of the biggest, and I’m sticking to that. I’m sticking to that opinion right now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, I guess one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader says, is the ability to change your mind, right? Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if the thesis is invalidated, for whatever reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
Would you consider them as part of your strategy, or do you think they’re too speculative at this point? I know AI is a hot topic, but I’m curious if you see any long-term potential there.

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just pumps for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was responsible for creating the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 is released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops. It’s a constant cycle of reinvention and evolution.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins. They’re something entirely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I would meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple—like, "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people really love the AI coins.

Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely wild. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.

[22:46 -> 22:55]

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Murad:  
AI memes are an interesting concept, but I’d approach them with caution. While I think AI as a sector has immense potential, the memecoin space is inherently speculative. If an AI meme project aligns with my criteria—strong community, clear vision, and long-term viability—I might consider it. But again, I’m not in a rush to add anything new.

He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your main focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my focus is primarily on community building and education. I’m spending a lot of time in Telegram chats, answering questions, and helping people understand the broader trends. I’m also refining my strategies and keeping an eye on the market to ensure that I’m prepared for what’s coming next. It’s all about staying disciplined and making sure the foundation is strong for the next big wave.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the true believers—those who stay, buy more, and remain fully committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These individuals are not going to sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to identify what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, for me personally, I need to connect with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. Combining all of these factors is how you build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]  
Host:  
Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be difficult for you to change your mind now. If you wanted to add a new coin to the list, what would you do? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell and replace it with another? Have you thought about this? It’s something that’s been on my mind, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. But if you study past cycles, the big winners tend to run for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think you’d agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there needs to be a very, very passionate community behind it. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m totally fine with that. For me, I know from past cycles that the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought coins and held them for a year, even two years, right?  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
That’s what I’ve decided to do with my portfolio. Even after all the recent metas, I still think my coins are going to end up being some of the biggest, and I’m sticking to that. I’m sticking to that opinion right now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, I guess one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader says, is the ability to change your mind, right? Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if the thesis is invalidated, for whatever reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
I mean, AI is such a hot topic right now, and it feels like it’s bleeding into every sector, including crypto. Do you think there’s potential for AI-themed memecoins to become a significant part of this supercycle?

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just pumps for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was responsible for creating the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 is released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation in this space never stops. It’s relentless, and that’s what keeps it so exciting.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins—something entirely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I’d meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple: "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking, but it feels less intuitive.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people really love the AI coins.

Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely insane. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.  

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that's going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
Yeah, I think CEX listings are significant because there are still many people globally who rely on centralized exchanges rather than interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to view it is that these listings enhance distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]

The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the true believers—those who stay, buy more, and remain fully committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These individuals won’t sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to identify what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, I personally need to connect with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. By combining all of these factors, you can build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]  
Host:  
Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be hard for you to change your mind now. If you wanted to add a new coin to the list, what would you do? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell and replace it with another? Have you thought about this? It’s something that’s been on my mind, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. But if you study past cycles, the big winners tend to run for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think you’d agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there needs to be a very, very passionate community behind it. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m totally fine with that. For me, I know from past cycles that the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought coins and held them for a year, even two years, right?  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
That’s what I’ve decided to do with my portfolio. Even after all the recent metas, I still think my coins are going to end up being some of the biggest, and I’m sticking to that. I’m sticking to that opinion right now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, I guess one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader says, is the ability to change your mind, right? Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if the thesis is invalidated, for whatever reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
I mean, AI is such a hot topic right now, and it feels like there’s a lot of overlap between the AI narrative and the memecoin space. Do you think there’s potential there, or is that something you’d avoid?

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just pumps for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was driving the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 gets released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic and unpredictable.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would argue they’re more like AI agent coins—something entirely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I’d meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple—"Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking, but it feels less intuitive.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people are really into the AI coins.

Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely insane. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that's going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts on that?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
CEX listings are definitely important because there are still many people around the world who rely on centralized exchanges rather than interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings contribute to both distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve also mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or nearly finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just staying locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your main focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my focus is primarily on refining my strategies and ensuring that the communities I’m involved with are well-informed and aligned. Telegram chats are definitely a big part of that, but I’m also spending a lot of time analyzing market trends and preparing for what’s ahead. It’s all about staying disciplined and making sure everything is in place for the next big moves.

[24:00 -> 24:18]  
Host:  
Yeah, so I actually tweeted about this earlier today. I said there are two ways to make it or survive in this space. One is hyper-gambling on-chain, and the other is finding hardcore communities of believers. This aligns with my overall thesis that the meme coin asset class has two subcategories: short-term gambling and long-term community building.  

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]

AI memes are interesting, but I think they’re still in their infancy. I’m not saying they won’t have their moment, but for now, I’m not convinced they’re ready to be part of my portfolio. I’d rather wait and see how that space evolves before making any commitments.

You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the true believers—those who stay, buy more, and remain fully committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These individuals won’t sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to identify what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, I personally need to connect with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. Combining all of these factors is how you build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]  
Host:  
Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be difficult for you to change your mind at this point. If you wanted to add a new coin to your list, how would you go about it? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell it and replace it with another? Have you considered this? It’s something I’ve been thinking about, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. However, if you study past cycles, you’ll notice that the big winners tend to perform well for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think we can agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there must be a very, very passionate community behind the coin. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m completely fine with that. From my experience with past cycles, the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought...  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
...coins and held them for a year, sometimes even two years. That’s the approach I’ve decided to take with my portfolio. Despite all the recent metas, I still believe the coins I’ve chosen will end up being some of the biggest winners. I’m sticking to that belief for now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
One trait of a good investor, as SL Trader often says, is the ability to change your mind, right? Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if your thesis is invalidated for any reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m holding these until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
Would you consider them as part of your portfolio, or do you think they’re too speculative? I know AI is a hot topic right now, but I’m curious if you see any long-term potential there.

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just pumps for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was responsible for creating the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 is released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops. There’s always something new on the horizon, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins—something entirely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I’d meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s straightforward—like, "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people really love the AI coins.

[22:02 -> 22:44]  
Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely wild. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.  

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that's going to create some massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts on that?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
CEX listings are definitely important because there are still many people around the world who rely on centralized exchanges and don’t interact directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings enhance distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve also mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just staying locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your main focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my focus is on refining the strategies I’ve already put in place and ensuring that the communities I’m involved with are well-informed and aligned. Telegram chats are definitely a big part of that, but I’m also spending a lot of time analyzing market trends and preparing for what’s ahead. It’s all about staying disciplined and making sure everything is optimized for the next big moves.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.

This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the believers—those who stay, buy more, and are truly committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These people won’t sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to understand what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, I personally need to resonate with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. Combining all of these factors is how you build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]  
Host:  
Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be hard for you to change your mind now. If you wanted to add a new coin to the list, what would you do? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell and replace it with another? Have you thought about this? It’s something that’s been on my mind, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. But if you study past cycles, the big winners tend to run for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think you’d agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there needs to be a very, very passionate community behind it. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m totally fine with that. For me, I know from past cycles that the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought coins and held them for a year, even two years, right?  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
That’s what I’ve decided to do with my portfolio. Even after all the recent metas, I still think my coins are going to end up being some of the biggest, and I’m sticking to that. I’m sticking to that opinion right now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, I guess one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader says, is the ability to change your mind, right? Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if the thesis is invalidated, for whatever reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
I mean, AI is such a hot topic right now. Do you think there’s potential for AI-themed memecoins to gain traction, or do you think it’s just a passing trend?

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just a pump for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself created the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 is released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic and unpredictable.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins. They’re something entirely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I would meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple—like, "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking, but it’s definitely not as intuitive.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people are really into the AI coins.

Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely wild. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that's going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts on that?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
Yeah, I mean, CEX listings are significant because there are still many people globally who rely on centralized exchanges rather than interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings enhance distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. Obviously, you’ve mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just staying locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my primary focus is on refining my strategies and ensuring that the communities I’m involved with are well-informed and aligned. Telegram chats are definitely a big part of that, but I’m also spending a lot of time analyzing market trends, studying on-chain data, and preparing for what’s to come. It’s all about staying disciplined and making sure everything is in place for the next big moves.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context.

Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Intuitively, you’ll start to understand what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, I personally need to resonate with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. Combining all of these factors is how you build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]

Hey, TYI here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe. I don’t run YouTube ads or have sponsors on this channel, so I’d really appreciate your support. Your engagement helps this video reach more people, which allows me to book better guests in the future. Now, back to the episode.

[28:07 -> 28:30]  
Host:  
A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be difficult for you to change your mind now. If you wanted to add a new coin to the list, how would you approach it? Do you think you’re able to add coins to the list? If you feel you’re wrong about a particular coin, is it possible for you to sell and replace it with another? Have you considered this? It’s something I’ve been thinking about, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. However, if you study past cycles, the big winners tend to perform well for over a year, sometimes even two years in a row.  

First of all, I think we can agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there must be a very, very passionate community behind the coin. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m completely fine with that. From my experience with past cycles, the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought...  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
...coins and held them for a year, sometimes even two years. That’s the strategy I’ve decided to follow with my portfolio. Even with all the recent metas, I still believe the coins I’ve chosen will end up being some of the biggest winners, and I’m sticking to that. That’s my stance for now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader often says, is the ability to change your mind. Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if the thesis is invalidated for any reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Murad:  
AI memes are interesting, but I think they’re still in their infancy. I’m not saying they won’t have their moment, but for now, I’m focusing on what I believe has the highest probability of success. If AI memes mature and show real potential, I might reconsider, but it’s not a priority for me at this stage.

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just pumps for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was responsible for creating the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When GPT-4 or GPT-5 is released, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic and unpredictable.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins—something completely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I would meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple—like, "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking, but it feels less intuitive.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people really love the AI coins.

[22:02 -> 22:44]  
Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely insane. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that's going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts on that?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
CEX listings are definitely important because there are still many people around the world who rely on centralized exchanges instead of interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings simply enhance distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve also mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your main focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my focus is primarily on managing the community and ensuring that everyone is aligned with the broader vision. Telegram chats are definitely a big part of that, but I’m also spending a lot of time analyzing market trends and refining strategies. It’s all about staying disciplined and preparing for what’s ahead.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s limited time for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the true believers—those who stay, buy more, and remain fully committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you aim to succeed. These individuals are not going to sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are numerous metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. Tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient can help assess these. You can also examine the average investment per wallet. Over time, you’ll intuitively start to recognize what I call "cults." These communities score very highly on many of these metrics.

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
I mean, AI is such a hot topic right now, and it feels like it’s bleeding into every sector, including crypto. Do you think there’s potential for AI-themed memecoins to become a significant part of the next cycle?

[32:41 -> 33:19]

A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months.

A couple of months ago, you shared your top 10 picks for this cycle and mentioned that you’re sticking with them. First of all, I really applaud you for being so transparent—having a public list, making your wallet public, and committing to a social contract not to sell.

[28:30 -> 29:03]  
Host:  
It seems like it would be difficult for you to change your mind at this stage. If you wanted to add a new coin to your list, how would you go about it? Do you think it’s possible to add coins to your portfolio? If you feel you’ve made a mistake with a particular coin, is it feasible for you to sell it and replace it with another? Have you considered this? It’s something I’ve been thinking about, and I’d love to hear your perspective.  

[29:03 -> 29:58]  
Murad:  
The crypto markets are definitely evolving from cycle to cycle. However, if you study past cycles, you’ll notice that the big winners tend to perform well for over a year, sometimes even two years straight.  

First of all, I think we can agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas that come and go, but one critical factor remains constant: there has to be a very, very passionate community behind the coin. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m completely fine with that. From my experience with past cycles, the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought...  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
...coins and held onto them for a year, sometimes even two years. That’s the strategy I’ve decided to follow with my portfolio. Despite all the recent shifts in metas, I still believe the coins I’ve chosen will end up being some of the biggest winners. I’m sticking to that belief for now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
One trait of a good investor, as SL Trader often says, is the ability to change your mind. Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if your thesis is invalidated for any reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I won’t sell any of them until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
I mean, AI is such a hot topic right now. Do you think there’s room for AI-themed memecoins in this supercycle, or do you think it’s just a passing trend?

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just a pump for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself created the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When they release GPT-4 or GPT-5, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic and unpredictable.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins—something completely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I would meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple: "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s like a mid-curve way of thinking.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people really love the AI coins.

Extracted Highlights:
[22:02 -> 22:44]  
Speaker 1:  
Speaking of meme coins, I always try to draw parallels between what’s happening now and past events because it helps me make sense of things. Someone shared a tweet from August 10, 2020—Binance was listing YFI, and people were creating spreadsheets of all the DeFi tokens being listed during DeFi Summer. DeFi Summer was absolutely insane. I have a feeling that the current meme coin cycle is going to be the equivalent of DeFi Summer. For instance, Coinbase just listed Pepe, and Robinhood is relisting Solana right after delisting it at its lows, along with other meme coins.

[22:46 -> 22:55]  
Host:  
What do you think the effects are? Obviously, these big centralized exchanges (CEXs) are listing meme coins. What do you think that means for the trenches? Do you think that’s going to create a massive wealth effect? What are your thoughts?  

[22:57 -> 23:16]  
Murad:  
CEX listings are definitely important because there are still many people around the world who rely on centralized exchanges rather than interacting directly with the blockchain. The way to look at it is that these listings contribute to both distribution and liquidity. So, centralized exchanges remain a crucial part of the overall ecosystem.  

[23:17 -> 23:30]  
Host:  
Got it, got it. I’ll ask you about your meme coin picks later, but here’s an audience question. Mr. Smile Dan says, "I think you post a lot of inspirational videos on your Twitter. I just love them—I like all of them."  

[23:31 -> 23:44]  
Host:  
He also mentioned that you’ve said people who work really hard and stay focused in 2025 will be rewarded in 2026. You’ve also mentioned that your meme coin picks are already finalized or 90% finalized. So, what are you doing now? Are you just locked in, managing the community in Telegram chats? What’s your main focus these days?  

[23:56 -> 24:18]  
Murad:  
Right now, my primary focus is on refining the strategies we’ve already put in place and ensuring that the community is well-informed and aligned. Telegram chats are definitely a big part of that, but I’m also spending a lot of time analyzing market trends and preparing for what’s to come. It’s all about staying disciplined and making sure we’re ready to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.

[24:19 -> 24:31]  
Murad:  
The latter is about trying to build the next Dogecoin, and that’s where my interest lies. It’s all about community building—whether through artwork, media growth, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, giveaways, competitions, Twitter engagement, or anything in between.  

[24:32 -> 24:48]  
Host:  
Got it. So, I guess you’re just locked in. I’ve also been looking into meme coins. Of course, you have your picks, but you’ve mentioned there’s room for hundreds of billion-dollar meme coins.  

[24:49 -> 25:07]  
Host:  
You’ve also said that to make generational wealth, you need to identify the cults—the strong communities, mission-driven coins, and so on. Another audience question is: How does one go about researching these cults? Is there a specific method or approach you use to identify them?  

[25:08 -> 25:26]  
Host:  
What do you need to see to recognize a new cult forming? Because while you’ve already identified some, I’m sure there will be new ones. What characteristics should people look out for?  

[25:28 -> 25:56]  
Murad:  
For me personally, I only look at projects that are at least three months old. You could be a bit more aggressive and lower that threshold to two or even one month, but it’s not something that just launched today. You need some time to allow a cult-like following to form.

[25:57 -> 26:17]  
Murad:  
In my experience, it takes around seven to eight months for something to truly deserve being called a cult in this context. This is also why I believe most of the major cults have already been created. If I’m correct that we only have about a year left in this cycle, there’s only so much time left for new ones to take off.

[26:20 -> 26:49]  
Murad:  
To exist over time, you want to see two or three dips of around 70% or more. What that does is flush out the so-called "non-believers," leaving behind the believers—those who stay, those who buy more, and those who are truly committed. That’s exactly the kind of demographic you want during future pumps if you want to succeed. These people are not going to sell, even for a 100x return.

[26:49 -> 27:50]  
Murad:  
On-chain, there are so many metrics you can analyze: diamond-handedness ratios, average time held, decentralization, and various forms of distribution. You can use tools like the Gini coefficient or the HHI coefficient to assess these. You can also look at the average investment per wallet. Intuitively, you’ll start to grasp what I call "cults." These communities rank very highly on many of these metrics.  

On the subjective side, for me personally, I need to resonate with the artwork, the videos, and the people involved. There has to be a unique vibe in the Telegram or Discord chats. Combining all of these factors together is how you build a complete picture.

[27:50 -> 28:07]

First of all, I think you’d agree that this is a memecoin cycle. Sure, there will be different memecoin metas, but one critical factor remains constant: there needs to be a very, very passionate community behind the coin. That’s non-negotiable.  

I’m sure there will be runners that I’ll miss, and I’m completely fine with that. From my experience with past cycles, the people who succeeded in crypto were those who bought...  

[30:02 -> 30:20]  
Murad:  
...coins and held them for a year, sometimes even two years. That’s the approach I’ve decided to take with my portfolio. Even with all the recent metas, I still believe the coins I’ve chosen will end up being some of the biggest winners. I’m sticking to that belief for now.  

[30:20 -> 30:47]  
Interviewer:  
You know, I guess one trait of a good investor, as SL Trader says, is the ability to change your mind, right? Are you open to selling one of these tokens at some point if the thesis is invalidated for any reason? Or are you saying, “These are my final picks, and I’m not going to change my mind. I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025,” regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak?

[30:47 -> 31:02]  
Murad:  
I’m not selling any until Q4 of 2025, regardless of whether their price performance is strong or weak.  

[31:02 -> 31:10]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, I respect that. Are you open to adding more coins to your list, or is that something you’re not considering?  

[31:10 -> 31:37]  
Murad:  
I might add one or two, but I want to be extremely conservative. My whole strategy and philosophy is to not jump from thing to thing. I don’t want to be, quote-unquote, “calling new coins” every week or every two weeks. I think it’s much more valuable to stay loyal to your existing picks.  

[31:37 -> 31:57]  
Murad:  
Why? Because I believe what people actually want is safety, not gambling. The more coins you call, the more you diminish that sense of safety. You have to be selective in terms of your holdings and beliefs. For me, I’d rather pursue what you might call a “tight-aggressive strategy” in poker. Think of it as measuring 100 times and picking once. I’m very comfortable with my existing picks, and I’m sticking to them for now.  

[31:57 -> 32:18]  
Interviewer:  
Got it. Okay, so you’re open to maybe one or two, but probably not more because you don’t want to be jumping the gun or chasing trends. Obviously, I have to mention the ticker and whatnot, but would you be open to, let’s say, AI memes?  

[32:18 -> 32:41]  
Interviewer:  
I mean, AI is such a hot topic right now, and it feels like it’s bleeding into every sector, including crypto. Do you think there’s potential for AI-themed memecoins to gain traction, or is that something you’d avoid?

[32:41 -> 33:19]  
Murad:  
A couple of things. First of all, my whole strategy—and if you notice all of my past ten picks—is that I like to buy things that have been out there for at least several months. Frankly, the longer, the better, because then I can see that a significant amount of time has passed, and the community is still thriving.  

[33:19 -> 33:36]  
Murad:  
The second thing is, I only ever buy during big dips. I never buy during rips. I only buy during significant downturns.  

[33:38 -> 37:35]  
Murad:  
With that strategy, you're going to miss a lot of runners, but you're also not going to be buying tops. For me, that approach has worked quite well so far. I don't like to buy something that's been "up only." I prefer to buy things when people have temporarily forgotten about them.  

The third point I want to make—and I'm not here to argue against your thesis, but rather to present my own—is that it's undeniable AI will continue improving in the coming years. It's going to make exponential strides. However, the issue is that, over the last two years, we've seen the cost—in terms of time, skill, and labor—of creating a large codebase collapse very quickly.  

What I believe we’ll see is that defensible moats in anything technological, particularly in the crypto sphere, are going to diminish to zero. Why? Because if it's open source—even if you're not a scam project and are producing legitimate revenues—a lot of the current fees will no longer be viable. Thousands of people will be creating open-source codebases that are cheaper or even completely free. These will be battle-tested, forked repeatedly, and even AI agents will be testing and refining the code.  

Initially, the vision for blockchain was to build a world without middlemen. My belief is that the long-term future is one where all blockchain-related things should be free, almost free, or at least at cost. Slowly but surely, I think that's the direction the world is heading.  

Now, you have to ask yourself: what is valuable in a world where AI is everywhere? My belief is that, over the next 50 years, the things that will be at a premium will actually be biological. Outside of crypto, this includes fitness, health, community gatherings, and social events. Inside of crypto, this is why I'm bullish on BTC and cult memecoins. Their value proposition isn't technological; it's based on community, belief, faith, and, to some extent, liquidity and Lindy effects.

[37:37 -> 37:43]  
Murad:  
From now on, there will always be another shinier thing, and so on and so forth. Maybe that happens with AI memes, or maybe it doesn’t.  

[37:43 -> 37:57]  
Murad:  
But we’re already seeing a progression. We started with AI memes that were just a pump for fun, initiated by some random individual. Then we moved to AI memes where the AI itself was responsible for creating the pump.  

[37:57 -> 38:02]  
Murad:  
Now, we even have wallets that are autonomously controlled. There’s always this continuous chain of upgrades.  

[38:02 -> 38:16]  
Murad:  
When they release GPT-4 or GPT-5, it’s possible that an OpenAI or Anthropic employee—or someone else entirely—might go on to create another coin. Who knows? I’m just speculating here.  

[38:16 -> 38:24]  
Murad:  
The point is, innovation never stops. It’s a constant cycle, and that’s what keeps this space so dynamic.

[38:24 -> 38:38]  
Murad:  
This sense of security comes from groups of people. I’m not sure how strong these AI communities are, but personally, I don’t really know how to "meme" them. Are they even really meme coins?  

[38:38 -> 38:53]  
Murad:  
I would say they’re more like AI agent coins—something completely different. I mean, I can maybe meme something like "Apu" or "Popcat" to my grandma, but I have no idea how I would meme the "Z Bros" or "Goats" of the world.  

[38:53 -> 39:13]  
Murad:  
At least with dog coins, it’s simple—like, "Oh yeah, it’s a cute dog." But with an AI agent coin, you have to explain it. Maybe it’s a mid-curve way of thinking.  

[39:13 -> 39:23]  
Host:  
Yeah, exactly. I think DeFi people really love the AI coins.
