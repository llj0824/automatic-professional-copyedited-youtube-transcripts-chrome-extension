[00:07] podcast by night all
[00:11] day all right we&amp;#39;re rolling good to see
[00:14] you sir here we
[00:16] go um one of the things I wanted to talk
[00:18] to you about I wanted to play this but
[00:21] we decided we shouldn&amp;#39;t play it because
[00:23] uh it could get copyright strike and we
[00:25] don&amp;#39;t want to get the episode we don&amp;#39;t
[00:27] want anybody to have any sort of a way
[00:29] to get it down sure but it was the
[00:32] episode of you when you&amp;#39;re on The View
[00:34] and I think it was 2015 or6 like when
[00:38] you were running for president right and
[00:41] you sat you got introduced as our friend
[00:44] Donald Trump that&amp;#39;s right whoopy
[00:46] Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss
[00:48] Joy bayar gives you a big hug Barbara
[00:51] Walters gives you a big hug they all
[00:53] loved you they were all talking about
[00:56] how your uh you might be
[01:00] you might be conservative in your
[01:03] financial positions but you&amp;#39;re very
[01:05] liberal socially they were they&amp;#39;re
[01:07] talking about you in such a favorable
[01:09] light the audience was
[01:12] cheering and then you actually started
[01:14] winning in the polls and then the
[01:16] machine started working towards you yeah
[01:19] but it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s probably no one in
[01:22] history that I&amp;#39;ve ever seen that&amp;#39;s been
[01:25] attacked the way you&amp;#39;ve been attacked
[01:27] and the way they&amp;#39;ve done it so coord at
[01:30] and systematically when you see those
[01:32] same people in the past very favorable
[01:34] to you like Oprah when you were on Oprah
[01:36] Show she was encouraging you last week I
[01:39] did one of our last shows I think maybe
[01:41] Thursday or Friday that was a big deal
[01:43] being on Oprah&amp;#39;s show the last one and I
[01:45] was like one of the last shows in that
[01:47] last that final week and I said boy
[01:50] we&amp;#39;ve come a long way since since that
[01:53] what was it like uh well the concept it
[01:56] was really like two different lives you
[01:58] know I had a a very wonderful life but I
[02:01] I wanted to do this The Apprentice was
[02:02] still going very strong we had 12
[02:05] seasons and uh we had actually uh 14
[02:09] Seasons 12 years over they had a couple
[02:11] of well they canceled the Apprentice
[02:12] when you were running for president
[02:14] correct no they had Arnold SCH a
[02:16] do it I was involved in that and I want
[02:19] I I had enough of it and we did great it
[02:21] was doing great but they wanted me to
[02:24] stay they all came to see me they said
[02:26] we&amp;#39;re going to give you a contract they
[02:27] wanted to extend my contract Mark
[02:29] Bernett is a great guy and they wanted
[02:31] to extend the contract Mark said you&amp;#39;re
[02:33] crazy don&amp;#39;t run don&amp;#39;t run no nobody
[02:36] gives up prime time they said you know
[02:37] it&amp;#39;s one of those little things which is
[02:39] probably true nobody gives a prime time
[02:41] though for being president for for
[02:43] running well for running against 20 some
[02:46] people you know turned out to be 18 18
[02:49] professional people you know mostly
[02:50] politicians they said who would do this
[02:53] I mean it&amp;#39;s a long shot actually the
[02:54] heads of NBC came over the uh Paul tgy
[02:58] all the all the top people came over to
[03:00] see me try and talk me out of it because
[03:01] they wanted to have me extend The
[03:03] Apprentice was doing well so it was 14
[03:06] Seasons it was 12 years we had one two
[03:09] seasons where we had a double which
[03:11] rarely happens it was just a hot show
[03:13] and uh I said you know I want to do this
[03:16] what happened is uh previously like
[03:19] three years four years before that they
[03:21] did a poll they had Mitt Romney and
[03:23] somehow they put me in a poll and I blew
[03:26] everybody away I blew him away which
[03:28] isn&amp;#39;t that hard frankly but I blew
[03:30] everybody away and I said that&amp;#39;s
[03:31] interesting because I never really gave
[03:33] it that much real thought I thought
[03:35] about it but never real thought but I
[03:36] saw these polls were very good and so I
[03:39] was thinking about doing it then but I
[03:40] had a contract with the Apprentice plus
[03:42] I was building two big buildings at the
[03:44] time and I wanted to make sure they got
[03:45] finished up properly and it was one of
[03:47] those things the kids were just sort of
[03:49] getting involved they&amp;#39;re very capable
[03:51] kids but they were getting involved
[03:52] early on so I did that I got them done I
[03:55] had some very good successes and I came
[03:58] on and then I thought about it for the
[04:00] next one after the Romney disaster and I
[04:04] ran and I won against Hillary it was
[04:07] quite an experience but it was a
[04:09] different life because you&amp;#39;re right the
[04:11] view I was on The View many many times
[04:13] and uh they loved me just the way people
[04:16] would talk I mean even if people had
[04:17] criticisms about you people that didn&amp;#39;t
[04:19] like you there was always feuds and
[04:21] stuff like that but the reality was the
[04:24] thing turned on you when they found out
[04:26] that you were going to be president it
[04:27] was very coordinated and some people are
[04:30] catching on to that now there&amp;#39;s a lot of
[04:32] people that were longtime Democrats like
[04:34] Elon and Bill Amman and all these
[04:37] different very intelligent people and
[04:38] they support me now Bill supports me
[04:40] he&amp;#39;s been very supportive too what this
[04:42] is what I wanted to ask you what was it
[04:45] like when you actually got in CU nobody
[04:47] really can prepare you for that when
[04:49] you&amp;#39;re running for president you don&amp;#39;t
[04:50] really know what it&amp;#39;s going to be like
[04:52] when you actually get into office what
[04:54] was the what did you think it was going
[04:56] to be like in office or when I decided
[04:58] to run so no when you got in when I was
[05:00] in so when I was in and one and was in
[05:03] the White House essentially well first
[05:06] of all it was very surreal oh you know
[05:08] it&amp;#39;s very interesting when I got shot it
[05:10] wasn&amp;#39;t surreal that should have been
[05:12] surreal when I was laying on the ground
[05:13] I knew exactly what was going on I knew
[05:15] exactly where I was hit they were saying
[05:18] you were hit all over the place because
[05:20] there was so much blood from the ear you
[05:22] would know that better than anyone when
[05:23] they get the ear torn up ear bleed a lot
[05:25] bleed anyway so and and I was thinking
[05:29] the other day
[05:30] when when that happened I really knew
[05:32] where I was I knew exactly what happened
[05:35] I said I wasn&amp;#39;t hit anywhere else with
[05:37] the with the presidency it was a very
[05:40] surreal experience okay and what&amp;#39;s day
[05:43] one like you win you get inaugurated
[05:46] holy I&amp;#39;m the president yeah that&amp;#39;s
[05:48] what happened so I&amp;#39;m driving down
[05:49] Pennsylvania Avenue I just built a
[05:51] building on pen you know the hotel the
[05:53] old post office it was we called it
[05:55] Trump
[05:56] National uh hotel and we sold it to the
[06:00] Waldorf Historia and it was a wonderful
[06:03] thing but I&amp;#39;m driving down I&amp;#39;m passing
[06:04] the hotel you&amp;#39;ve never seen so many
[06:07] motorcycles police
[06:09] military you know it was a major thing I
[06:12] got off really the first time I used Air
[06:15] Force One landed and we&amp;#39;re coming down
[06:18] and they were it was very be I mean it
[06:21] was incredible and we&amp;#39;re going down
[06:23] Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite
[06:24] direction you know normally you&amp;#39;re used
[06:26] to going one way and all of a sudden
[06:28] you&amp;#39;re going the other way the street
[06:30] was loaded up and I wanted to go out and
[06:33] I wanted to wave to everybody but that
[06:35] wasn&amp;#39;t smart you know that KS a little
[06:38] bit dangerous right I mean when you
[06:40] watch like Kennedy and some others right
[06:43] but I really felt I don&amp;#39;t know the love
[06:45] was so crazy and so I did get out of the
[06:49] car for a brief you know just for a very
[06:50] short walk I thought it was very
[06:52] important to do and milania got out with
[06:54] her beautiful dress on that became sort
[06:56] of a staple it was uh people loved it
[06:59] and
[07:00] Baron and we&amp;#39;re walking down the street
[07:03] but where it really got amazing we get
[07:06] to the White House and now it&amp;#39;s a little
[07:09] bit uh little bit before dark
[07:11] beautiful and we went up to the
[07:14] president&amp;#39;s quarters they call them the
[07:16] presidential quarters and I&amp;#39;m standing
[07:20] in this beautiful hallway I you know
[07:22] it&amp;#39;s funny nobody ever talks about the
[07:24] White House as being beautiful inside
[07:26] you know you think it&amp;#39;s going to be
[07:27] everything&amp;#39;s going to be all metal doors
[07:29] and stuff it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s so beautiful I
[07:32] made my money largely on luxury the
[07:35] hallway is like 25 ft wide the ceiling
[07:38] Heights are you every it&amp;#39;s so beautiful
[07:41] but I was standing there and I said to
[07:44] the guys I want to see the Lincoln
[07:45] bedroom I had never seen the Lincoln
[07:47] bedroom I&amp;#39;d heard about the Lincoln
[07:49] bedroom and I was standing with my wife
[07:53] I said Do you believe it this is the
[07:54] Lincoln bedroom I mean it was like it
[07:59] was it was amazing because it&amp;#39;s look if
[08:03] you love the country but here you are
[08:05] the Lincoln bedroom and the bed you know
[08:08] he was very tall he was 6&amp;#39;6 which then
[08:10] would be like like Baron right would be
[08:13] like Baron Trump he&amp;#39;s 69 but 6&amp;#39;6 he was
[08:18] very tall then on top of that he wore
[08:19] there it is he wore that yeah there it
[08:21] is it&amp;#39;s a long bed elongated bed and
[08:24] because very you know people were
[08:26] shorter than you see some of the chairs
[08:28] are very very low to the ground actually
[08:31] but he had the long bed and they had uh
[08:35] you had the Gettysburg Address right on
[08:37] that right under that you can&amp;#39;t see it
[08:39] here but right there the original
[08:40] version of the Gettysburg address and
[08:43] this is the original and I&amp;#39;m looking and
[08:45] I just looked around I said Do you
[08:48] believe this because I was never a pol
[08:51] first of even if you were a politician
[08:52] but I was never a politician it just I
[08:54] sort of just started right and all of a
[08:57] sudden I&amp;#39;m standing in the White House
[08:58] and it was uh very very surreal that
[09:01] room was so beautiful to me much more
[09:03] beautiful than it actually is you know
[09:05] to me when I looked at the bed and the
[09:07] bed you could see was a little bit
[09:08] longer had to be a little bit longer uh
[09:11] he lost his son and they suffered the
[09:14] two of them suffered from melancolia
[09:16] they didn&amp;#39;t call it depression they
[09:18] called it melancolia and they suffered
[09:21] from it he was a very depressed guy and
[09:24] she was a very depressed woman more so
[09:27] than him and on top of that they lost
[09:29] their son whose name was Tad Tad and uh
[09:35] it was uh just seeing it in the little
[09:38] picture a little tiny picture I mean you
[09:40] can&amp;#39;t see the details there little tiny
[09:42] everything the W was a little tiny
[09:44] picture of Tad who he lost and it was
[09:49] devastating and he was you know he was a
[09:52] look he was in a war he was he and he
[09:55] was having a hard time because he
[09:56] couldn&amp;#39;t beat Robert E Lee Robert E Lee
[09:58] won like 13 battles in a row and he was
[10:01] getting like a phobia like a fighter you
[10:03] know a lot about the fight stuff but
[10:06] like I went to a UFC fight and it was a
[10:11] champion who was 14- one about a year
[10:14] ago you would know the names 14 and one
[10:17] and the only guy he lost to was this one
[10:18] guy but the guy that he was fighting was
[10:21] like almost just an average fighter lost
[10:24] numerous times but he beat this one guy
[10:27] so I said okay I really don&amp;#39;t know who
[10:29] you&amp;#39;re talking abouty I I will figure it
[10:31] out okay but about a year ago but the
[10:33] point is that he lost he wasn&amp;#39;t nearly
[10:35] the fighter as the but the one who was
[10:38] not nearly the fighter had beaten he&amp;#39;s
[10:40] the only guy that beat the the champ
[10:42] like five years before and I said I&amp;#39;ll
[10:45] take the guy that won the other fight
[10:47] and that&amp;#39;s what happened he beat him a
[10:48] second time sometimes psychological
[10:50] advantage is this crazy thing uh Lincoln
[10:54] had a I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ve never read this
[10:56] I heard it from people in the way house
[11:00] who really understand what was going on
[11:02] with with the whole life of the White
[11:04] House but Lincoln had uh The Yips about
[11:08] in a way as the golfers would say he had
[11:10] a phobia about Robert El Lee said I
[11:12] can&amp;#39;t beat Robert because Robert E Lee
[11:15] won many battles in a row he was just
[11:17] beating the hell out of you know they
[11:18] tried to get Robert Elite to be on the
[11:20] north but he said no I have to be with
[11:22] my state you know the state was his
[11:24] whole thing and and he went to the South
[11:27] and he was uh I&amp;#39;ve had generals tell me
[11:30] we have some great generals the real
[11:31] generals not the ones you see on
[11:32] television the ones that beat Isis with
[11:35] me we defeated Isis and record time it
[11:37] was supposed to take years and we did it
[11:40] in a matter of weeks he&amp;#39;s are great
[11:42] generals he&amp;#39;s a tough guys he&amp;#39;s a not
[11:44] woke guys but their favorite General in
[11:48] terms of Genius was Robert El Le
[11:51] strategy strategy strategically he took
[11:53] a war that should have been over in a
[11:56] few days and it was you know years of
[11:59] head hell a vicious war and um so here I
[12:04] am standing there and again I had never
[12:08] really done this before you know I ran I
[12:09] ran a number of months before I won I
[12:13] probably uh I guess if you figured Max
[12:16] it out it would be a year something like
[12:19] that so I had never run for office and I
[12:22] did well I mean I I went into debates we
[12:25] had 18 people including me and then
[12:27] slowly but surely they started to
[12:29] disappear we had debates good debates
[12:32] everyone&amp;#39;s aware of all this stuff but
[12:33] what I want to get to is like what was
[12:34] the experience once you got inside like
[12:37] what did you think it was going to be
[12:38] like in terms of like your ability to
[12:40] govern like this is your first
[12:42] experience governing anything you never
[12:44] been a govern you never been a mayor
[12:46] private private stuff business but now
[12:49] all of a sudden you&amp;#39;re inside the White
[12:50] House the biggest thing was just that
[12:52] first moment of being in this hallowed
[12:55] it was really a hallowed place to me it
[12:57] was it was beyond to me that&amp;#39;s that was
[12:59] the experience it was a surreal
[13:01] experience and then with time that wears
[13:05] off with time it becomes you know your
[13:07] place where you stay and right uh I was
[13:10] doing a lot of I was I had two things
[13:13] that I really focused on governing the
[13:15] country and uh
[13:18] survival because from the moment I won
[13:22] before I got to office all of a sudden
[13:24] it I mean they came down I mean nobody
[13:27] has ever been treated that way
[13:30] and and you see that I mean you see
[13:31] we&amp;#39;re in the Washington Post very early
[13:33] on they said well now the impeachment
[13:35] stuff starts and it did I mean it
[13:36] literally started from the beginning so
[13:38] I had survival and run the nation I had
[13:40] a a combination most people don&amp;#39;t have
[13:42] the survival they get in uh what did you
[13:46] expect though in terms of like once you
[13:48] got inside you had to appoint all these
[13:50] people like how many appointments did
[13:52] you have to make you have you actually
[13:54] 10,000 uh appointments now they&amp;#39;re
[13:57] different you know you have big ones and
[13:58] then they appoint right 100 people and
[14:00] 200 people and but the president really
[14:03] is is involved with approximately 10,000
[14:06] appointments so you&amp;#39;ll appoint a
[14:08] secretary of state and he will he or she
[14:10] will appoint a lot of people so it&amp;#39;s a
[14:11] lot but in terms of major ones you
[14:14] probably have like a h 100 but they&amp;#39;re
[14:15] big ones uh treasury State uh military
[14:21] and how did you know who to a point well
[14:24] I I didn&amp;#39;t I had no experience you have
[14:26] to understand I was there 17 times in
[14:29] Washington and I never stayed over
[14:31] according to the Press which I think is
[14:32] probably right over the years I was only
[14:35] there 17 times I never stayed over so
[14:38] now I&amp;#39;m sitting there I&amp;#39;m saying this
[14:41] place is gorgeous but you know I don&amp;#39;t
[14:42] know anybody it&amp;#39;s like you you you know
[14:44] you go to certain areas and other areas
[14:47] they may be great Washington was great
[14:49] Washington&amp;#39;s not so great right now
[14:51] they&amp;#39;re got to we got to fix it we got
[14:52] to make it better very dangerous place
[14:54] very badly maintained place we&amp;#39;re going
[14:57] to make it great we&amp;#39;re going to make it
[14:58] better better we&amp;#39;re going to bring it
[14:59] back but I wasn&amp;#39;t a Washington guy I was
[15:02] a New York guy I was a New York Builder
[15:04] and I I built buildings in New York and
[15:06] I knew that whole world but I didn&amp;#39;t
[15:08] know the Washington world too well and
[15:10] all of a sudden you&amp;#39;re supposed to be
[15:12] appointing top people so what did you
[15:14] think it was going to be like versus
[15:16] like did you have any ideas of what it
[15:17] was going to be like and what was
[15:19] different well I was always involved in
[15:21] politics but usually from the standpoint
[15:22] of of a donor I was a donor you know I
[15:24] was a big donor I gave money to
[15:26] politicians I enjoyed Poli rats right a
[15:30] de both really pretty much both I have
[15:32] actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and
[15:34] me when I was very young you were a
[15:35] Democrat until like what year uh I was a
[15:38] Democrat um I could get you the exact
[15:42] but the the early 90s the early 90s I I
[15:46] switched over eventually actually uh
[15:48] they had a reform party I was thinking
[15:50] about doing that for a little while but
[15:51] then fortunately I didn&amp;#39;t because it&amp;#39;s
[15:53] very hard you know it&amp;#39;s a two-party
[15:55] system and anytime you hear third party
[15:57] I know you like RF K junr and so do I
[16:00] he&amp;#39;s a fantastic gu I do but I thought
[16:01] that being an independent was nonsense
[16:03] it doesn&amp;#39;t work it doesn&amp;#39;t work because
[16:05] even if you do great you&amp;#39;re not going to
[16:07] get Congress in other words you need now
[16:10] to say okay now I&amp;#39;ll get half of
[16:11] Congress never going to vote for you so
[16:13] even if you got there which is very hard
[16:16] and but and I know how you feel about
[16:19] Bobby and I feel the same way and he&amp;#39;s
[16:21] now with us but it it doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s real
[16:23] it&amp;#39;s pure and simple it&amp;#39;s a two-party
[16:25] system right and uh somebody I won&amp;#39;t
[16:28] mention his name but somebody spent $250
[16:30] million trying to get the nomination as
[16:32] a Reform Party candidate or whatever and
[16:35] they got just nowhere you get eaten you
[16:37] just get eaten the system eats you alive
[16:40] right so uh so it was it was really
[16:44] somebody that Not only was new to
[16:46] Washington but was new to
[16:48] politics so in in the office of the
[16:54] presidency over the years all those
[16:56] presidents you&amp;#39;ve had 92 2% were
[17:00] politicians and 8% were Generals General
[17:03] Eisenhower General Washington right
[17:05] General George Washington he had
[17:06] generals so it&amp;#39;s 8% no Admirals 8%
[17:10] generals and 92% politicians you know
[17:13] they&amp;#39;re politicians and they go on so
[17:15] they never had a business guy or they
[17:17] never had a guy that wasn&amp;#39;t elected to
[17:19] an office um they were all like Ronald
[17:21] Reagan was really he was a movie actor
[17:23] and then but he became the governor of
[17:25] California for I think two terms and
[17:27] then he ran
[17:29] uh so you&amp;#39;d never had a thing like this
[17:31] but I you know in terms of me and some
[17:34] sometimes i&amp;#39; use it as an excuse and I
[17:37] don&amp;#39;t like having excuses actually but
[17:39] I&amp;#39;d use it as an excuse I had to rely on
[17:42] people that I respected or liked but
[17:45] that I didn&amp;#39;t know that well because I
[17:47] didn&amp;#39;t know them that well some of those
[17:49] people I campaigned against because you
[17:51] know when you have 18 people we had
[17:52] mostly politicians running in the
[17:54] election you know running in the
[17:56] primaries and they got knocked out one
[17:58] by one but I got to like some of them
[18:00] some of them I didn&amp;#39;t like at all and I
[18:02] don&amp;#39;t like them now and I&amp;#39;d rely on them
[18:05] and I&amp;#39;d rely on other people so all of a
[18:07] sudden people would come in I&amp;#39;d like to
[18:08] recommend so and so to be Secretary of
[18:11] State and I&amp;#39;d have three four people
[18:13] recomend one thing I can tell you
[18:15] everybody wants the position of course
[18:17] no no but sometimes I&amp;#39;ll hear a lot of
[18:20] people don&amp;#39;t want to work with Trump
[18:21] because Trump is tough to work with Etc
[18:23] let me tell you everybody wants to be
[18:26] any one of these positions they die for
[18:28] it of course now they don&amp;#39;t want to be
[18:29] known I mean there&amp;#39;s a particular guy in
[18:33] uh New York primarily very big very big
[18:37] very successful very uh very strong very
[18:40] political although he&amp;#39;s not a politician
[18:43] he&amp;#39;d give anything to be Secretary of
[18:45] State but if they ask him no I don&amp;#39;t
[18:47] think I would do it but in the
[18:49] meantime begging for it okay begging
[18:52] they all I believe everybody look
[18:53] everybody wants it but my by the way no
[18:56] matter what you do every but it&amp;#39;s very
[18:59] dangerous to pick somebody outside of a
[19:00] politician because a politician&amp;#39;s been
[19:02] basically vetted for years right you
[19:04] pick a business guy and they&amp;#39;ve never
[19:07] been vetted at all and they&amp;#39;re you know
[19:09] the head of a big company or something
[19:10] but they&amp;#39;ve never been vetted you know
[19:12] nothing about his personal life you know
[19:14] nothing about where he&amp;#39;s been when you
[19:16] put him in it&amp;#39;s a little bit dangerous
[19:18] because all of a sudden they get checked
[19:20] up and you hear things that you&amp;#39;re
[19:21] saying wow this is not going to work out
[19:23] too well so it&amp;#39;s very dangerous picking
[19:26] picking people that are outside of
[19:28] politics is somewhat dangerous so you&amp;#39;re
[19:30] kind of stuck in a position we have to
[19:32] pick established people then the problem
[19:34] with established people is established
[19:35] people are already indoctrinated into
[19:37] the system and they&amp;#39;re stiffs in many
[19:39] cases stiffs they&amp;#39;re survivors I find
[19:43] that you know what do you mean by stiffs
[19:45] when you say stiffs stiff they don&amp;#39;t
[19:46] they don&amp;#39;t have nothing they have
[19:48] nothing
[19:49] or they&amp;#39;re smart and survival one one
[19:52] little thing so there was a congressman
[19:53] years before I ran and I was very close
[19:56] to him and I needed a license on
[19:59] something and he was very important in
[20:00] getting the license but it was a little
[20:02] bit controversial the license this
[20:04] particular thing that was being licensed
[20:07] but I was close to this guy and helped
[20:09] him and everything else and I went to
[20:11] him I said I&amp;#39;d like to have you help and
[20:13] he said uh let me take a look at it I
[20:17] said oh that&amp;#39;s not too good uh but I
[20:20] really hope you&amp;#39;re going to help and
[20:21] anyway he tapped me along for a long
[20:22] period of time and ultimately didn&amp;#39;t do
[20:24] it and I said you are a stiff you could
[20:26] have done this thing so easy Etc but it
[20:28] was controversial he was in Congress for
[20:31] many years like 28 years and you know
[20:33] there&amp;#39;s a reason when somebody&amp;#39;s there
[20:35] for 28 years you got to be S of smart
[20:37] you know you have all scals and I
[20:40] realized he was a Survivor and so they
[20:42] never do anything controversial they
[20:44] never take any chances or speak their
[20:46] opinion that&amp;#39;s outside of the yeah and
[20:49] yet I don&amp;#39;t disrespect him for it I
[20:51] actually respected the guy more than a
[20:52] in a certain way I said survive you know
[20:54] what he&amp;#39;s been there like for 28 years
[20:58] and he made it through a lot of people
[20:59] don&amp;#39;t make it through it&amp;#39;s a good way
[21:01] for non-exceptional people to survive
[21:03] well it is I mean it certainly is so
[21:05] you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re in there you have 10,000
[21:08] appointments you have to make like so
[21:10] you&amp;#39;re getting advice from people and it
[21:12] at one point in time did you have a
[21:13] moment in time where you realize like
[21:16] these are bad choices like some of these
[21:18] people I shouldn&amp;#39;t have had in there oh
[21:20] yeah I think so the one question that
[21:22] you&amp;#39;ll ask me that I think you&amp;#39;ll ask me
[21:25] that see people seem to ask and I always
[21:27] come up with the same answer
[21:29] uh if I I the one mistake cuz I did I
[21:32] had a lot of success great economy great
[21:34] everything everything was great we the
[21:37] military we rebuilt it biggest tax cuts
[21:39] in history all this stuff we did we had
[21:42] a great presidency uh three Supreme
[21:44] Court Justices most people get none you
[21:46] know you pick them young this way
[21:49] they&amp;#39;re there for 50 years right so you
[21:51] know even if a president is there for
[21:53] eight years often times they never have
[21:55] a chance I had three it was sort of the
[21:57] luck of the draw but
[21:59] uh I I will say that it always comes
[22:01] back to the same
[22:03] answer the biggest mistake I made was I
[22:05] picked some people I picked some great
[22:07] people you know but you don&amp;#39;t think
[22:09] about that I picked some people that I
[22:12] shouldn&amp;#39;t have picked I picked a few
[22:14] people that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have picked and
[22:18] neocons yeah neocons or bad people or
[22:20] disloyal people or people that were just
[22:24] people that were into the got bad advice
[22:26] yeah I mean look I mean you reading
[22:27] about them a little little bit today a
[22:30] guy like Kelly who is a bully a bully
[22:32] but a weak a weak person you know you
[22:34] know more about bullies than anybody
[22:35] probably around cuz you deal in a a
[22:37] certain sport where the bullies are
[22:39] exposed very quickly yeah but you know
[22:42] uh he&amp;#39;s bad uh Bolton was an idiot but
[22:45] he was great for me because I&amp;#39;d go in
[22:47] with a guy like a John Bolton you know
[22:49] John Bolton a friend of mine called
[22:51] called me up I was picking Bolton and
[22:53] he&amp;#39;s a very smart guy his name is Phil
[22:55] Ruff and he&amp;#39;s a very rich guy from Las
[22:57] Vegas one of the he a great card player
[23:00] he doesn&amp;#39;t play cards but he&amp;#39;s a great
[23:01] play you know he&amp;#39;s just a natural got
[23:04] poker sense right you know the good old
[23:06] poker sense and Phil Ruffin is is a very
[23:09] very wise kind of a guy and very one of
[23:13] the richest people around and has had
[23:16] great success and understands people so
[23:19] it was in that I was picking Bolton or I
[23:21] picked Bolton he called up he said don&amp;#39;t
[23:23] pick him well he&amp;#39;s a bad guy I&amp;#39;ve now he
[23:26] wasn&amp;#39;t in politics at all he in various
[23:29] businesses he said he&amp;#39;s a bad guy he&amp;#39;s
[23:33] just it always works out bad with that
[23:36] guy I said oh man I wish you told me
[23:38] this two weeks ago I already hired him
[23:40] you know he&amp;#39;s here and and he was right
[23:43] but but he was good in a certain way
[23:46] he&amp;#39;s a nut job and every time I had to
[23:49] deal with the country when they saw this
[23:53] wack job standing behind me they said oh
[23:56] man Trump&amp;#39;s going to go to war with him
[23:58] this he was with Bush when they went
[24:00] stupidly into the Middle East they
[24:01] should have never done it I used to say
[24:03] it as a civilian so I always got more
[24:06] publicity than other people and I didn&amp;#39;t
[24:08] it wasn&amp;#39;t like I was trying in fact I
[24:11] don&amp;#39;t know exactly why maybe you can
[24:13] tell me when I could definitely tell you
[24:15] he said a lot of wild
[24:17] maybe maybe he said a lot of wild
[24:20] and then CNN in their all their
[24:22] brilliance by highlighting your wild
[24:24] made you much more popular yeah and
[24:27] they boosted you in the PO cuz people
[24:28] were tired of someone talking in this
[24:32] pre-prepared politician lingo
[24:36] and even if they didn&amp;#39;t agree with you
[24:37] they at least knew whoever that guy is
[24:40] that&amp;#39;s him that&amp;#39;s really him when you
[24:42] see certain people talk certain people
[24:44] in the public eye you don&amp;#39;t know who
[24:46] they are you have no idea who they are
[24:48] it&amp;#39;s very difficult to know you see them
[24:50] in conversations they have these
[24:51] pre-planned answers they say everything
[24:53] it&amp;#39;s very rehearsed you never get to the
[24:56] meat of it what the one of the beautiful
[24:58] things about you is that you free ball
[25:00] like you get out and you do these huge
[25:03] events and you&amp;#39;re just talking and
[25:04] you&amp;#39;re making we we&amp;#39;ve highlighted you
[25:06] on the show many times where when you
[25:08] did this Biden impression where he&amp;#39;s
[25:09] walking around he doesn&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s
[25:10] doing it&amp;#39;s funny it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s standup it&amp;#39;s
[25:12] funny stuff but it&amp;#39;s like you and you
[25:15] were making fun of Elon one time you
[25:16] doing an Elon impression it&amp;#39;s great you
[25:19] you have like comedic instincts like
[25:21] when you said to Hillary you&amp;#39;d be in
[25:22] jail like that&amp;#39;s great timing yeah but
[25:25] it&amp;#39;s like that kind of stuff was unheard
[25:27] of as a politician like no one had done
[25:30] that and I think you know what&amp;#39;s funny
[25:32] you need at least the attitude of a
[25:35] comedian when you&amp;#39;re doing this business
[25:38] this is a very dangerous business first
[25:40] of so it&amp;#39;s a very tough business when
[25:41] it&amp;#39;s the most dangerous business the
[25:43] most well for for a job yes I mean other
[25:45] than going to war and being a
[25:47] firefighter or being a cop it&amp;#39;s the most
[25:50] dangerous business the most dangerous
[25:51] being president is the most dangerous
[25:53] especially you I mean you haven&amp;#39;t even
[25:56] got to the election there&amp;#39;s been two
[25:57] assassinations attempts and they&amp;#39;ve
[26:00] brushed those out of the news like it
[26:01] was nothing yeah they&amp;#39;d rather not talk
[26:03] about them imagine if there was
[26:04] assassination attempts on Biden how hard
[26:07] people would be attacking the right how
[26:09] they would be trying to get guns taken
[26:11] away from people they would try to ramp
[26:13] up gun laws they would try to figure out
[26:15] some way to blame you if there was a tax
[26:17] on if Biden got shot in the ear we would
[26:19] have never heard the end of it but I
[26:21] think he&amp;#39;s in good shape because it&amp;#39;s
[26:23] only consequential presidents if you
[26:25] take a look at what&amp;#39;s happened look I&amp;#39;m
[26:28] for having countries pay us billions and
[26:31] billions and trillions even dollars I
[26:33] took in hundreds of billions of dollars
[26:35] from China nobody took in 10 cents not
[26:37] one other president I do things that
[26:39] make it I mean that don&amp;#39;t necessarily
[26:42] make me so popular I just do what&amp;#39;s
[26:44] right and when you do that you know
[26:46] you&amp;#39;re more look at look at Iran Iran we
[26:48] would have never had the attack on
[26:50] Israel at all Iran was broke I told
[26:53] China if you buy you can&amp;#39;t do business
[26:55] in the United States under any cir I was
[26:57] going to we going to go cold turkey with
[26:59] China some people think that would have
[27:01] been a good idea anyway but if you buy
[27:03] any oil one barrel of oil from them
[27:05] you&amp;#39;re not doing business I said that to
[27:07] many countries Iran was broke they had
[27:09] no money for Hezbollah they had no money
[27:11] for Hamas they had no but I make myself
[27:15] you know I mean I understand what I&amp;#39;m
[27:17] doing you make yourself a Target and
[27:20] it&amp;#39;s a very dangerous business but if
[27:23] you just look it
[27:24] statistically so I I said I saw thing I
[27:27] don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s right but 1/10th of
[27:29] 1% for a race car driver yeah it&amp;#39;s
[27:31] pretty dangerous business right yeah uh
[27:33] one1 of 1% for a bull rider I I tell you
[27:37] to me talk these guys that ride the
[27:39] Bulls is worse than UFC is worse these
[27:41] guys you see these big monster bulls and
[27:44] you see it in slow motion where the the
[27:46] foot is like you know an inch away from
[27:49] the head if it hits him the guy&amp;#39;s gun
[27:50] but they die you know they die so one/
[27:52] tenth of 1% die what you&amp;#39;re saying yeah
[27:54] one tenth of 1% die right and they
[27:56] certainly get hurt badly really mean
[27:58] they can&amp;#39;t walk after a certain period
[27:59] of time but but with the president if
[28:03] you look at the amount of assassination
[28:06] and attempts too and attempts no it&amp;#39;s a
[28:08] very dangerous position I never thought
[28:10] of that by the way when I did it I you
[28:11] know you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t tend to I did
[28:13] you just assume because people loved you
[28:15] on The Apprentice they were going to
[28:16] love you as a president think it would
[28:17] be so easy you know it&amp;#39;s probably would
[28:19] have been if the media didn&amp;#39;t attack you
[28:22] the way they did if they didn&amp;#39;t conflate
[28:24] you with Hitler I mean even today like K
[28:27] was talking about you and Hitler you&amp;#39;re
[28:29] they&amp;#39;re going to take what you said
[28:30] about Robert E Lee oh Donald Trump
[28:32] Wishes the South one that&amp;#39;s right he
[28:34] loves Robert they love to take things
[28:36] out of context and distort things but
[28:38] well they they don&amp;#39;t even have to take
[28:40] them out they make them up entirely okay
[28:41] they but you know it&amp;#39;s interesting when
[28:43] you mentioned the uh the I was very
[28:46] popular and and all those people love me
[28:49] I mean this uh some of these these women
[28:52] they&amp;#39;re so they&amp;#39;re so stupid and joy she
[28:57] would every time she&amp;#39;d see me like I&amp;#39;d
[28:59] be in the theater or something and she
[29:02] you have to be on the show again come on
[29:03] come on let&amp;#39;s go we have to she loved
[29:04] you she Lov me that episode where people
[29:07] should watch that episode just to see
[29:09] what we&amp;#39;re talking about like I said we
[29:10] don&amp;#39;t want to get a copyright strike so
[29:11] we&amp;#39;re not going to put it up but if you
[29:13] watch the episode it&amp;#39;s bananas it&amp;#39;s like
[29:15] an alternative universe and it&amp;#39;s only
[29:18] who n years ago whoopy loved loved you
[29:21] gives you a hug and a kiss and how about
[29:22] that other one the new one on there the
[29:24] uh the one from my Administration she
[29:27] writes me a letter the greatest
[29:28] president she leaves you know she worked
[29:31] as like an assistant press secretary I
[29:33] hardly knew her but she leaves and she
[29:35] writes me this gorgeous letter what&amp;#39;s
[29:38] her name she was uh I don&amp;#39;t even know
[29:40] you know she anyway she was in the
[29:42] administration she&amp;#39;s on now currently
[29:44] sits on the far right hand side whatever
[29:46] the hell her name is and and she writes
[29:49] a letter the most beautiful letter she&amp;#39;s
[29:51] quoted in the paper he&amp;#39;s a consequential
[29:53] he was the greatest president blah blah
[29:55] blah then all of a sudden she goes to
[29:57] view and she said hitting the hell out
[29:58] of me because they won&amp;#39;t hire unless
[30:00] I&amp;#39;ve had many people go on CNN and they
[30:02] call said I don&amp;#39;t know what to do what
[30:04] they want to pay me a lot but I have to
[30:06] be negative and knew I said be negative
[30:08] that&amp;#39;s okay there are guys on like CNN
[30:11] they won&amp;#39;t hire them Shawn Duffy is a
[30:14] you know congressman and he retired he
[30:16] got a good job with CNN but he was only
[30:18] positive about Trump so they kept him
[30:21] but they would never put him on I mean I
[30:24] respect what he did he could have gone
[30:25] you know negative I tell people go
[30:28] negative you know let my friends make
[30:29] the money well it&amp;#39;s so crooked the Press
[30:31] is so crooked CR it&amp;#39;s crooked but it&amp;#39;s
[30:33] also they&amp;#39;re diminishing themselves
[30:36] they&amp;#39;re they they are they&amp;#39;re killing
[30:37] all their credibility and it&amp;#39;s opening
[30:39] up the credibility to New Media it&amp;#39;s
[30:41] opening up the credibility to
[30:42] Independent Media all these the worst
[30:43] I&amp;#39;ve ever seen though and I&amp;#39;ve seen the
[30:46] worst I mean I&amp;#39;ve been a part of it I&amp;#39;ve
[30:48] been I&amp;#39;ve seen the worst kamla goes on
[30:50] 60 Minutes gave an answer that a child
[30:54] wouldn&amp;#39;t give it was so bad in 60
[30:57] minutes
[30:58] took the answer out they took the whole
[31:01] and they put another answer in they
[31:03] edited it deceptively which didn&amp;#39;t make
[31:04] sense either but it was better they took
[31:07] the well it wasn&amp;#39;t editing it was fraud
[31:09] yeah this was not editing you know
[31:10] editing is where I&amp;#39;ll give an answer and
[31:12] they&amp;#39;ll take a couple of words and
[31:14] change them around or they might even
[31:15] take a sentence or two off which is very
[31:17] bad but that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of bad you know
[31:19] I&amp;#39;d give an answer which was a very good
[31:21] answer I always talk about you know I
[31:24] like to give long The Weave you know I
[31:26] like to you like to weave things in yeah
[31:28] but when you do the weaves and you have
[31:29] to be very smart to do weaves when you
[31:31] do the weave look at this just in this
[31:33] one thing we&amp;#39;re talking about little
[31:34] pieces here but always ends up no no it
[31:37] comes back home for the right people for
[31:39] the wrong people it doesn&amp;#39;t come back
[31:40] home when they end up in the wilderness
[31:42] right but but they can take my answer
[31:46] and you know what they may take a little
[31:47] piece of it out or something and they
[31:49] use the term yes we want to save time
[31:51] well it&amp;#39;s not but I&amp;#39;ve never heard I
[31:54] think it&amp;#39;s the biggest scandal in
[31:56] broadcast history what happened to C CBS
[31:59] so you have CBS 60 minutes that&amp;#39;s a news
[32:01] program it&amp;#39;s not an entertainment
[32:03] program it&amp;#39;s under their news it&amp;#39;s the
[32:04] head of their news thing she gives an
[32:07] answer that was that shows that she&amp;#39;s
[32:09] essentially
[32:11] incompetent and they took the answer
[32:13] could you imagine them doing that for me
[32:14] we can show it if you want people to see
[32:16] it can we show it no we get in trouble
[32:18] we&amp;#39;ll get copyright strike okay I&amp;#39;ll
[32:21] listen anyone can find it but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
[32:24] drastic but what was interesting was the
[32:27] other full
[32:28] version was available initially it was
[32:30] like a preview they somebody made a big
[32:32] mistake somebody put that preview out
[32:33] there put the preview out and then the
[32:36] bosses did this or that and then all of
[32:37] a sudden they said we got a problem ex
[32:39] exactly and then they got caught by
[32:41] mistake well you but don&amp;#39;t you think
[32:43] that&amp;#39;s a bit to me and don&amp;#39;t forget this
[32:45] is election interference and fraud and
[32:49] it&amp;#39;s 60 minutes it&amp;#39;s their news division
[32:52] so they it&amp;#39;s a big deal they give those
[32:54] licenses out Joe for free they should
[32:57] pay for Fortune they&amp;#39;re worth a fortune
[32:59] they give them out for free because
[33:01] they&amp;#39;re using the public Airwaves with
[33:03] cable you don&amp;#39;t have that Cable&amp;#39;s
[33:05] different but you know it it&amp;#39;s just a
[33:08] different deal but with the networks
[33:10] they give those license they&amp;#39;re worth
[33:12] billions of dollars they give them out
[33:14] free but you have to be honest and all
[33:16] that was bad I think that David mure and
[33:18] that woman that was aside I never even
[33:20] heard of her but they kept interrupting
[33:22] me it was like I said how many people am
[33:24] I debating here I got this one and I got
[33:26] you two but he went after me 11
[33:29] different times you know it&amp;#39;s
[33:30] interesting I always thought he was a
[33:32] nice guy but he&amp;#39;s just like the rest of
[33:34] him you know well that&amp;#39;s his job
[33:36] unfortunately and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sure they want
[33:39] you&amp;#39;re right well the problem was they
[33:41] fact checked you and they didn&amp;#39;t fact
[33:42] check her and one of most egregious
[33:44] examples of that was when she said that
[33:47] there is there are no troops right now
[33:49] deployed in war zones there&amp;#39;s a very
[33:52] famous viral video that went online of
[33:54] troops in a war zone saying well what
[33:56] the are we then because there&amp;#39;s
[33:59] thousands of them Dan khaw the
[34:01] congressman uh posted on his Instagram
[34:04] all of the various examples of troops
[34:08] that are deployed thousands and
[34:10] thousands of troops that are currently
[34:11] deployed stupidly deployed but the point
[34:13] is if this is going to be an actual real
[34:15] debate and not a propaganda exercise if
[34:17] it&amp;#39;s going to be a real debate you have
[34:19] to fact check everybody like if someone
[34:21] says maybe she thought there was no
[34:23] which is also a problem so it&amp;#39;s one of
[34:25] two things it&amp;#39;s either it was not true
[34:28] was a lie on purpose which is terrible
[34:31] or it was the opposite it was ignorance
[34:34] which is also terrible well you when I
[34:35] said crime is soaring he said no no
[34:38] crime has gone down I said where did you
[34:40] hear that one crime has gone down I mean
[34:42] I&amp;#39;m debating with this guy but I&amp;#39;ve had
[34:45] that well there was amended FBI
[34:47] statistics that came out after that that
[34:49] showed the crime had gone up
[34:50] substantially and by the way the
[34:51] statistics were a fraud because when
[34:53] they put out the statistics they didn&amp;#39;t
[34:55] include some of the worst places they
[34:56] didn&amp;#39;t include some of the worst cities
[34:58] some of the most deadly places but when
[35:01] the real numbers came out I turned out
[35:03] to be right but I haven&amp;#39;t you turn out
[35:04] to be right but then there&amp;#39;s another
[35:05] problem unreported crime is way up
[35:08] because people have lost look the morale
[35:10] that the police department has in a lot
[35:12] of these cities where they&amp;#39;ve done this
[35:13] defund the police these the
[35:15] morale these poor cops it&amp;#39;s
[35:16] horrible it&amp;#39;s the dumbest idea of all
[35:18] time but what they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve
[35:21] they&amp;#39;ve made these cops feel terrible
[35:23] like good cops I think cops are just
[35:25] like everybody else most of them are
[35:27] great it&amp;#39;s like everybody else but if
[35:28] you run into one Carpenter and he does a
[35:30] shitty job in your house you say
[35:32] Carpenters suck but they don&amp;#39;t
[35:34] suck most of them are great and that&amp;#39;s
[35:36] the with cops but the point is like they
[35:39] they did all of these things in this
[35:41] very foolish way and these cops are
[35:44] suffering the consequences of it and so
[35:46] subsequently what happens is a lot of
[35:48] crime is unreported a lot of crime like
[35:51] you call the cops they&amp;#39;re too busy they
[35:52] can&amp;#39;t even get you or your house got
[35:54] broken into sorry you know it doesn&amp;#39;t
[35:56] even make a report there&amp;#39;s a lot of
[35:58] people that they just give up it&amp;#39;s so
[36:01] sad what&amp;#39;s happened and I&amp;#39;ll tell you
[36:03] what uh I go to police funerals and we
[36:07] went to one in Long Island I visited the
[36:09] family in Long Island a very big deal
[36:12] it&amp;#39;s so dangerous people don&amp;#39;t realiz
[36:14] the car dark Windows pull over he&amp;#39;s a
[36:19] gentleman please pull over door opens
[36:21] guy comes out
[36:22] firing even if they were allowed to pull
[36:24] out their gun which they&amp;#39;re not they
[36:26] can&amp;#39;t you know pull out time they still
[36:28] wouldn&amp;#39;t have time it&amp;#39;s every cop&amp;#39;s
[36:29] worst nightmare it they open a door and
[36:33] he was killed and his partner was hurt
[36:35] he was killed and you don&amp;#39;t have I mean
[36:38] you don&amp;#39;t even have an eighth of a
[36:39] second to think and it is such a
[36:42] dangerous job that in particular think
[36:44] of it you go up to a car you don&amp;#39;t know
[36:46] who&amp;#39;s sitting there with a gun and if
[36:47] they have a gun you really don&amp;#39;t have a
[36:49] chance you&amp;#39;re not allowed to have your
[36:50] gun out by the way you have they have
[36:52] very strict rules so number one there&amp;#39;re
[36:55] but even if you could have your gun out
[36:57] the door opens and a guy and bullets
[36:59] start firing out you know and especially
[37:01] where they have the dark Windows where
[37:03] they have the darkened Windows it is
[37:05] such a dangerous POS uh profession and
[37:08] it&amp;#39;s very hard to get cops now because
[37:11] they they&amp;#39;re not given any backup and
[37:13] you&amp;#39;re right you can you know they have
[37:15] like an eighth of a second to make a
[37:17] decision that&amp;#39;s going to change their
[37:18] life if they make the wrong decision
[37:20] they&amp;#39;re going to end up on the front
[37:21] page of every newspaper in in the
[37:23] country and they&amp;#39;re going to lose their
[37:25] house and their pension and their their
[37:27] job and their wife is going to be gone
[37:29] and everything&amp;#39;s going to be gone abely
[37:30] and there here&amp;#39;s another thing that
[37:31] people don&amp;#39;t talk about how many of them
[37:32] have PTSD probably most of them these
[37:35] guys are seeing people shot all the time
[37:37] you know I I&amp;#39;ve talked to a ton of cops
[37:40] about it and you know a lot of cops
[37:41] commit suicide a lot of cops are deeply
[37:43] depressed a lot of but we have to give
[37:45] them back their dignity we have to we
[37:48] can&amp;#39;t we just have to give them back you
[37:51] said it&amp;#39;s so good you you never hear so
[37:53] anybody say that you&amp;#39;re never going to
[37:54] have it perfect you&amp;#39;re going to have a
[37:56] bad apple in everything every profession
[37:58] but every time there&amp;#39;s a bad apple that
[38:00] gets massive publicity and it it taints
[38:02] everybody else but it&amp;#39;s also this very
[38:04] irresponsible thing where people say
[38:06] defund the police get rid of the police
[38:07] you know even com Harris was a part of
[38:09] that that it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a very stupid way
[38:11] to look at it what you should do is fund
[38:13] the police you should have better
[38:14] training you should have cops that feel
[38:16] more appreciated you do you should have
[38:18] some something that helps mitigate this
[38:20] PTSD that all of them suffer through
[38:22] right she was a big part of defund the
[38:25] police that was a big thing for her
[38:26] defund the police always to fund the
[38:28] police well was it&amp;#39;s a political idea
[38:31] but any anybody with that political
[38:33] thought I don&amp;#39;t think should be running
[38:34] for president and I think people are
[38:36] getting wise to it you know we&amp;#39;re doing
[38:38] pretty well now I don&amp;#39;t know maybe in a
[38:40] week from now say sorry about that I was
[38:42] wrong but we&amp;#39;re leading everything and I
[38:45] think we&amp;#39;re going to have a very good
[38:46] election but I tell because people are
[38:48] starting to get to know her but she was
[38:51] defund the police she was all these
[38:53] transgender operations you know if you
[38:56] wanted a sex change and you were in
[38:57] detention and you demanded a sex change
[39:00] they would give you a sex change well
[39:02] the wildest one is this idea of giving
[39:04] free sex change to illegal immigrants
[39:07] that&amp;#39;s right in detention that is the
[39:10] wildest thing is that the biggest
[39:12] problem you have you just walked here
[39:14] from Guatemala you need to become a girl
[39:16] but she was in favor of it so so think
[39:18] of it she was now she changed she
[39:20] changed 15 policies in fact I&amp;#39;m going to
[39:23] send her a Maga cap she stole your idea
[39:25] about no tax for tips
[39:27] I I came up with this idea that honestly
[39:30] nobody ever heard of and all now it took
[39:33] her two months but you know what all of
[39:34] a sudden it what caught fire and she
[39:36] just put it into a little speech yeah
[39:38] well I think we have I think we still
[39:40] have that issue I think that issue is a
[39:41] good one for us but um no we have a lot
[39:44] of good issues you know we had the the
[39:45] other day think of how simple some of
[39:46] these things are we&amp;#39;re trying to get
[39:48] cars built in the United States Detroit
[39:50] has been really tough It&amp;#39;s been a
[39:52] disaster they have a huge Factory a huge
[39:55] car auto plant being built by China in
[39:57] Mexico make cars sell them in the United
[39:58] States put everybody out of business
[40:00] right here we go again I said if that
[40:03] plant is there when I&amp;#39;m president I will
[40:05] put 100 or 200% tariffs on every car
[40:09] they&amp;#39;ll be unsalable in the United
[40:11] States and they just announced they&amp;#39;re
[40:13] not going to build the plant because
[40:14] they think I&amp;#39;m going to win think of it
[40:15] they&amp;#39;re not going to build the plant
[40:17] this was the biggest plant in the world
[40:19] it would have more than all of Michigan
[40:22] makes that&amp;#39;s how big you know this is
[40:24] what we&amp;#39;re getting to and I said if that
[40:28] plan goes up I want them to understand
[40:30] if I win I&amp;#39;m going to tax those cars at
[40:33] the rate of a 100 or 200% of piece so
[40:36] that you won&amp;#39;t be able to sell them in
[40:37] the United States they just announced
[40:39] they&amp;#39;re not going to build a plan yeah I
[40:40] read that I did a big favor for our
[40:43] country by doing that and I&amp;#39;m not even
[40:45] there yet to me the most beautiful word
[40:48] and I&amp;#39;ve said this for the last couple
[40:49] of weeks in the dictionary today and any
[40:53] is the word tariff it&amp;#39;s more beautiful
[40:56] than love it&amp;#39;s more beautiful than
[40:58] anything it&amp;#39;s the most beautiful word
[41:01] this country can become rich with the
[41:04] use the proper use of tariffs it&amp;#39;ll keep
[41:07] did you just float out the idea of
[41:09] getting rid of income taxes and
[41:11] replacing it with tariffs well okay were
[41:13] we serious about that our yeah sure why
[41:15] not because we ready our country was the
[41:19] richest in the relatively in the 1880s
[41:22] and
[41:23] 1890s a president who was assassinated
[41:26] named McKinley he was the Tariff King he
[41:29] spoke beautifully of terce his his
[41:31] language was really beautiful uh we will
[41:34] not allow the enemy to come in and take
[41:38] our jobs and take our factories and take
[41:40] our workers and take our families unless
[41:43] they pay a big price and the big price
[41:45] is tariffs and he&amp;#39;d speak like that but
[41:49] he was right and then around in the
[41:51] early 1900s they switched over stupidly
[41:53] to frankly an income tax and you know
[41:56] why because countries were putting a lot
[41:58] of pressure in America we don&amp;#39;t want to
[41:59] pay tariffs please don&amp;#39;t you you know
[42:01] they believe me they control our
[42:03] politicians if you look at the kind of
[42:05] numbers that these guys make then and
[42:09] now but we had a commission meeting in
[42:13] the uh 18 I think it was 1887 think of
[42:17] this problem we were so rich we had so
[42:21] much money we didn&amp;#39;t know what to do so
[42:23] they set up a blue ribbon Commission on
[42:26] tariffs and the sole purpose is what to
[42:29] do with all the money we had we were so
[42:32] rich because we were taxing other people
[42:35] for coming in and taking our jobs and
[42:38] China does it that&amp;#39;s what China did if
[42:40] you want to open a factory and sell cars
[42:43] if you build a factory or have a factory
[42:45] they don&amp;#39;t take our cars they they
[42:46] wouldn&amp;#39;t take our cars but if you build
[42:49] a plant in China you can do that Elon
[42:52] did that by the way Elon is great that
[42:55] guy is such a great guy I think you&amp;#39;re a
[42:57] fan of he is from a different planet
[43:00] he&amp;#39;s the greatest guy that rocket coming
[43:03] in I talk I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I told the story once
[43:06] or twice so you may have heard it
[43:08] because his speeches have been good did
[43:10] you see the one last night yeah 29,000
[43:12] people that was a and the one the night
[43:14] before was the same thing we are we are
[43:17] rocking and rolling but but Elon and I&amp;#39;m
[43:20] talking to this very important guy I
[43:22] said wait a minute I&amp;#39;m looking at
[43:24] something the television&amp;#39;s on muted
[43:25] right and I see just rocket it&amp;#39;s all
[43:28] Brown from the heat you know like 10,000
[43:32] Dees pouring down at thousands of miles
[43:34] an hour and I see this thing you know
[43:36] it&amp;#39;s like a 20 story building and it
[43:38] catches and I say to this guy&amp;#39;s an
[43:39] important guy wait a minute let me just
[43:42] put you to hold it I got to see this and
[43:45] I see this and and it&amp;#39;s going to crash I
[43:47] say it&amp;#39;s going to crash into the Gantry
[43:49] they call it a Gantry I said oh man
[43:51] that&amp;#39;s got to be a disaster cuz it&amp;#39;s
[43:53] starting to get very close and then all
[43:54] of a sudden you see the flames in the
[43:56] bottom
[43:57] and it boom and then you see the two
[43:59] arms grab it crazy and I forgot the guy
[44:02] I had him on the phone I forgot no I
[44:04] said the hell with no I called Elon I
[44:06] said was that you he said that was me
[44:09] and I said who else can do that he said
[44:10] nobody Russia can&amp;#39;t do it the United
[44:12] States nobody can do it you know I set
[44:15] up space force that was me and that&amp;#39;s
[44:16] the first time in 82 years that we
[44:18] opened another Branch since the Air
[44:20] Force and that&amp;#39;s going to be one of our
[44:23] most important things but think of what
[44:24] Elon does and he did one other thing
[44:27] that I never heard of it it&amp;#39;s uh
[44:30] starlink I went down to North Carolina
[44:33] Georgia the different places right I
[44:35] followed it right down and they had no
[44:38] communication the polls were all knocked
[44:39] down every and one of the guys in North
[44:42] Carolina said could you do me a favor do
[44:45] you know Elon Musk yes he endorsed me by
[44:48] the way he gave me the nicest
[44:49] endorsement to this the tougher he said
[44:51] the country&amp;#39;s going to fail you should
[44:53] do the same thing Joe because you cannot
[44:55] be voting for Kamala
[44:57] Kamala you&amp;#39;re not a Kamala person I know
[44:59] you I&amp;#39;ve watched you I know him better
