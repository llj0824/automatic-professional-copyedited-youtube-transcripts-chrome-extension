Joe Rogan:
Check it out, The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day. All right, we're rolling. Good to see you, sir. Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about—I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright struck, and we don't want to get the episode taken down. Sure. But it was the episode of you when you were on The View, and I think it was 2015 or '16, like when you were running for president, right? And you got introduced as our friend, Donald Trump. That's right. Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss. Joy Behar gives you a big hug. Barbara Walters gives you a big hug. They all loved you. They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering, and then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working against you.

Donald Trump:
Yeah, but there's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically. When you see those same people in the past, very favorable to you, like Oprah—when you were on Oprah's show, she was encouraging you. Last week, I did one of our last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday, that was a big deal being on Oprah's show, the last one. I said, "Boy, we've come a long way since then." What was it like?

Joe Rogan:
Well, the concept was really like two different lives. You know, I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons, and we actually had 14 seasons over 12 years. They canceled The Apprentice when you were running for president, correct?

Donald Trump:
No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that, and I had enough of it. We did great; it was doing great. But they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me. They said, "We're going to give you a contract." They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy, and they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, "You're crazy. Don't run. Don't run. Nobody gives up prime time." They said, "You know, it's one of those little things," which is probably true—nobody gives up prime time for running for president, for running against 20-some people. You know, it turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians. They said, "Who would do this?" I mean, it's a long shot. Actually, the heads of NBC came over, Paul Telegdy—all the top people came over to see me, trying to talk me out of it because they wanted me to extend The Apprentice, which was doing well. So it was 14 seasons, it was 12 years. We had one or two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show.

Joe Rogan:
And I said, "You know, I want to do this." What happened is, previously, like three years, four years before that, they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney, and somehow they put me in a poll, and I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn't that hard, frankly, but I blew everybody away. I said, "That's interesting," because I never really gave it that much real thought. I thought about it, but never real thought. But I saw these polls were very good, and so I was thinking about doing it then. But I had a contract with The Apprentice, plus I was building two big buildings at the time, and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly. And it was one of those things—the kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that, I got them done, I had some very good successes, and I came on. Then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster, and I ran, and I won against Hillary. It was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you're right—the view. I was on The View many, many times, and they loved me. Just the way people would talk. I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you, there were always feuds and stuff like that. But the reality was, the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president. It was very coordinated, and some people are catching on to that now. There are a lot of people that were longtime Democrats, like Elon and Bill Maher and all these different very intelligent people, and they support me now. Bill supports me; he's been very supportive too.

Joe Rogan:
What I wanted to ask you was, what was it like when you actually got in? Nobody really can prepare you for that. When you're running for president, you don't really know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office. What did you think it was going to be like in office?

Donald Trump:
Well, first of all, it was very surreal. You know, it's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear. You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, the ear bleeds a lot. Anyway, I was thinking the other day, when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened. I said I wasn't hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience.

Joe Rogan:
Okay, and what's day one like? You win, you get inaugurated—holy, I'm the president!

Donald Trump:
Yeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I just built a building on Penn—you know the hotel, the old post office? We called it Trump National Hotel, and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria. It was a wonderful thing. But I'm driving down, and you've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military. You know, it was a major thing. I got off—really, the first time I used Air Force One landed, and we're coming down, and it was very big. I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. You know, normally you're used to going one way, and all of a sudden you're going the other way. The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out, and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, that's a little bit dangerous, right? I mean, when you watch like Kennedy and some others, right? But I really felt—I don't know—the love was so crazy. And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do. Melania got out with her beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. People loved it. And Barron and we were walking down the street. But where it really got amazing was we get to the White House, and now it's a little bit before dark—beautiful. And we went up to the president's quarters, they call them the presidential quarters. And I'm standing in this beautiful hallway. You know, it's funny—nobody ever talks about the White House as being beautiful inside. You know, you think it's going to be all metal doors and stuff. It's not. It's so beautiful. I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide. The ceiling heights are—you every—it's so beautiful. But I was standing there, and I said to the guys, "I want to see the Lincoln bedroom." I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom. I had heard about the Lincoln bedroom, and I was standing with my wife. I said, "Do you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom." I mean, it was amazing because if you love the country, but here you are in the Lincoln bedroom. And the bed—you know, he was very tall. He was 6'6", which then would be like Barron, right? He would be like Barron Trump. He's 6'9", but 6'6"—he was very tall then. On top of that, he wore—that's it. He wore that—yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed, and because, you know, people were shorter. You see some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground, actually. But he had the long bed, and they had—you had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address. And this is the original, and I'm looking, and I just looked around. I said, "Do you believe this?" Because I was never a politician. Even if you were a politician, but I was never a politician. I just sort of started, right? And all of a sudden, I'm standing in the White House, and it was a very, very surreal experience. That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. You know, to me, when I looked at the bed, and the bed you could see was a little bit longer. It had to be a little bit longer. He lost his son, and they suffered. The two of them suffered from melancholia. They didn't call it depression; they called it melancholia, and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy, and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. And on top of that, they lost their son, whose name was Tad. Tad. And it was just seeing it in the little picture—a little tiny picture. I mean, you can't see the details. There was a little tiny—everything. The W was a little tiny picture of Tad, who he lost, and it was devastating. And he was, you know, he was in a war. He was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row, and he was getting like a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff, but like I went to a UFC fight, and it was a champion who was 14-1 about a year ago. You would know the names—14-1. And the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like almost just an average fighter, lost numerous times, but he beat this one guy. So I said, "Okay, I really don't know who you're talking about. I will figure it out." Okay, but about a year ago. But the point is that he lost. He wasn't nearly the fighter as the—but the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten. He's the only guy that beat the champ like five years before. And I said, "I'll take the guy that won the other fight." And that's what happened. He beat him a second time. Sometimes psychological advantage is this crazy thing. Lincoln had a—I don't know. I've never read this. I heard it from people in the White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of the White House. But Lincoln had the yips about—in a way, as the golfers would say, he had a phobia about Robert E. Lee. He said, "I can't beat Robert," because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of—you know, they tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, "No, I have to be with my state." You know, the state was his whole thing, and he went to the South. And I've had generals tell me—we have some great generals, the real generals, not the ones you see on television, the ones that beat ISIS with me. We defeated ISIS in record time. It was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals. They're tough guys. They're not woke guys. But their favorite general, in terms of genius, was Robert E. Lee. Strategically, he took a war that should have been over in a few days, and it was, you know, years of hell—a vicious war. And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. You know, I ran a number of months before I won. I probably, I guess if you figured it out, it would be a year, something like that. So I had never run for office, and I did well. I mean, I went into debates. We had 18 people, including me, and then slowly but surely they started to disappear. We had debates—good debates. Everyone's aware of all this stuff. But what I want to get to is like, what was the experience once you got inside? Like, what did you think it was going to be like in terms of your ability to govern? Like, this is your first experience governing anything. You never been a governor, you never been a mayor—private stuff, business. But now, all of a sudden, you're inside the White House.

Donald Trump:
The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed place. To me, it was beyond. That was the experience. It was a surreal experience. And then with time, that wears off. With time, it becomes, you know, your place where you stay. And I was doing a lot of—I had two things that I really focused on: governing the country and survival. Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden, I mean, they came down. I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And you see that. I mean, you see—we're in the Washington Post very early on. They said, "Well, now the impeachment stuff starts." And it did. I mean, it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation. I had a combination. Most people don't have the survival they get in. What did you expect, though, in terms of like once you got inside? You had to appoint all these people. Like, how many appointments did you have to make?

Donald Trump:
You have actually 10,000 appointments. Now, they're different. You know, you have big ones, and then they appoint, right? 100 people and 200 people. But the president really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. So you'll appoint a secretary of state, and he or she will appoint a lot of people. So it's a lot. But in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100, but they're big ones—Treasury, State, military. 

Joe Rogan:
And how did you know who to appoint?

Donald Trump:
Well, I didn't. I had no experience. You have to understand, I was there 17 times in Washington, and I never stayed over. According to the press, which I think is probably right, over the years, I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, and I'm saying, "This place is gorgeous." But you know, I don't know anybody. It's like you go to certain areas and other areas—they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great right now. They've got to—we've got to fix it. We've got to make it better. Very dangerous place. Very badly maintained place. We're going to make it great. We're going to make it better. We're going to bring it back. But I wasn't a Washington guy. I was...

Joe Rogan:
Welcome to The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All right, we're rolling. Good to see you, sir. Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about is an episode of you on The View from around 2015 or 2016 when you were running for president. You were introduced as our friend, Donald Trump. Whoopi Goldberg gave you a big hug, Joy Behar gave you a hug, Barbara Walters gave you a hug—they all loved you. They were discussing how you might be conservative in your financial positions but very liberal socially. The audience was cheering, and then you started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working against you. 

But there's probably no one in history who has been attacked the way you have, so coordinated and systematically. When you see those same people who were once very favorable to you, like Oprah, who encouraged you on her show, it’s quite a shift. I did one of our last shows last week, and I mentioned how far we've come since that time. 

What was it like for you back then? 

Donald Trump:
Well, the concept of it was really like two different lives. I had a wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong; we had 14 seasons over 12 years. They canceled The Apprentice when I was running for president, correct? No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that, but I had enough of it. We were doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me and said they were going to give me a contract to extend my time on the show. Mark Burnett, a great guy, said, "You're crazy, don’t run." Nobody gives up prime time for running for president, especially against 20-some people, which turned out to be 18 professional politicians. 

The heads of NBC came over to talk me out of it because they wanted me to extend The Apprentice, which was doing well. I said, "You know, I want to do this." Three or four years before that, they did a poll with Mitt Romney, and somehow I was included in it, and I blew everybody away. I thought that was interesting because I never really gave it much thought. I was building two big buildings at the time and wanted to ensure they were finished properly. My kids were just starting to get involved, and I had some good successes. 

Then I thought about running after the Romney disaster, and I won against Hillary. It was quite an experience, but it was a different life. I was on The View many times, and they loved me. Even people who had criticisms about me would talk positively. But everything changed when they found out I was going to run for president. It was very coordinated, and now some longtime Democrats, like Elon Musk and Bill Maher, support me. 

What was it like when you actually got into office? Nobody can really prepare you for that. 

Donald Trump:
When I got into the White House, it was very surreal. You know, it’s interesting—when I got shot, that should have been surreal, but it wasn’t. I knew exactly what was going on and where I was hit. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience. 

On day one, after winning and getting inaugurated, I was driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I had just built a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, and I passed it. You’ve never seen so many motorcycles and police; it was a major event. I got off Air Force One for the first time, and it was incredible. 

As I drove down Pennsylvania Avenue, I wanted to wave to everyone, but that wasn’t smart. I felt the love was overwhelming, so I did get out of the car for a brief moment. Melania was with me, wearing a beautiful dress that became iconic. 

When we got to the White House, it was just before dark, and I went up to the presidential quarters. I was standing in this beautiful hallway, and it’s funny—nobody ever talks about the White House being beautiful inside. I made my money largely on luxury, and the hallway is 25 feet wide with high ceilings. I wanted to see the Lincoln bedroom, which I had never seen before. 

Standing there, I said to my wife, "Can you believe this is the Lincoln bedroom?" It was amazing. If you love the country, being in the Lincoln bedroom is something special. The bed was elongated because Lincoln was very tall—6'6". 

I looked around and saw the original version of the Gettysburg Address. I was never a politician, and suddenly I was standing in the White House. It was surreal. The room was beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. 

Lincoln lost his son, Tad, and both he and Mary suffered from melancholia, which they didn’t call depression back then. It was devastating for them. Lincoln had a hard time during the war, especially against Robert E. Lee, who won many battles in a row. 

I remember going to a UFC fight where a champion lost to an average fighter. Sometimes, psychological advantages can be a crazy thing. Lincoln had a phobia about Robert E. Lee, thinking he couldn’t beat him. 

I had never really done this before. I ran for about a year before I won. I went into debates with 18 people, and slowly they started to disappear. What I want to get to is what the experience was like once you got inside. What did you think it was going to be like in terms of your ability to govern? 

The first moment of being in that hallowed place was beyond anything I could have imagined. It was surreal, and over time, that feeling wears off as it becomes your place. I was focused on governing the country and survival because from the moment I won, I was treated differently than anyone else. 

The Washington Post said, "Now the impeachment stuff starts," and it did. I had to focus on survival and running the nation. Most people don’t have that combination. 

What did you expect in terms of appointments? 

I had to make about 10,000 appointments. The president is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments, but in terms of major ones, there are about 100. I had no experience in Washington. I had only been there 17 times and never stayed overnight. Now I was sitting there, saying, "This place is gorgeous, but I don’t know anybody." Washington isn’t what it used to be; it’s dangerous and poorly maintained. We need to make it great again.

## Attempt 1

[00:01 -> 00:59]
Joe Rogan:
Welcome to The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. Good to see you, sir. Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about is an episode of you on The View from around 2015 or 2016 when you were running for president. You were introduced as our friend, Donald Trump. Whoopi Goldberg gave you a big hug, Joy Behar gave you a big hug, Barbara Walters gave you a big hug—they all loved you. They were discussing how you might be conservative in your financial positions but very liberal socially. The audience was cheering, and then you actually started winning in the polls, and that’s when the machine started working against you.

[01:00 -> 02:58]
Donald Trump:
Yeah, but there’s probably no one in history who has been attacked the way I’ve been attacked, and the way they’ve done it so coordinated and systematically. When you see those same people in the past who were very favorable to you, like Oprah, when I was on her show, she was encouraging. Last week, I did one of our last shows, maybe Thursday or Friday, and it was a big deal being on Oprah’s show. I said, “Boy, we’ve come a long way since then.” It was really like two different lives. I had a wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong; we had 14 seasons. They canceled The Apprentice when I was running for president, correct? 

[02:59 -> 04:56]
Joe Rogan:
Right, but they had Arnold Schwarzenegger take over. You were involved in that, but you decided to step away. 

[04:57 -> 05:58]
Donald Trump:
I had enough of it. It was doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me and said they were going to give me a contract to extend my time on the show. Mark Burnett, a great guy, said, “You’re crazy, don’t run.” Nobody gives up prime time for running for president, especially against 20-some people, which turned out to be 18 professional politicians. They said, “Who would do this?” The heads of NBC came over to talk me out of it because they wanted me to extend The Apprentice. 

[05:59 -> 07:12]
Donald Trump:
I said, “I want to do this.” Three or four years before that, they did a poll with Mitt Romney, and somehow they included me in it. I blew everybody away, which isn’t that hard, frankly. I thought that was interesting because I never really gave it much thought. I was thinking about doing it then, but I had a contract with The Apprentice and was also building two big buildings at the time. I wanted to make sure they got finished properly. My kids were just starting to get involved; they’re very capable, but they were getting involved early on. 

[07:13 -> 08:56]
Donald Trump:
I got those projects done, had some successes, and then I thought about running after the Romney disaster. I ran and won against Hillary. It was quite an experience, but it was a different life. I was on The View many times, and they loved me. Even people who had criticisms about me would talk positively. But everything changed when they found out I was going to be president. It was very coordinated, and some people are catching on to that now. There are a lot of longtime Democrats, like Elon Musk and Bill Maher, who support me now. 

[08:57 -> 10:56]
Joe Rogan:
What was it like when you actually got into office? Nobody can really prepare you for that. 

[10:57 -> 12:01]
Donald Trump:
When I was in the White House, it was very surreal. When I got shot, that should have been surreal, but it wasn’t. I knew exactly what was going on. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience. The first moment of being in that hallowed place was beyond anything I could have imagined. Over time, it becomes your place where you stay. I was focused on governing the country and survival because from the moment I won, I was treated differently than anyone else. 

[12:02 -> 13:59]
Donald Trump:
The impeachment stuff started right from the beginning. I had to balance survival with running the nation. I had to make approximately 10,000 appointments, which includes big ones like the Secretary of State and others. I had no experience in Washington; I had only been there 17 times and never stayed overnight. Now I was in this gorgeous place, but I didn’t know anybody. Washington is not so great right now; it’s a dangerous place that needs fixing.
