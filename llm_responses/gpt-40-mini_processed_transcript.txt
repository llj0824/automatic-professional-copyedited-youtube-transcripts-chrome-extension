Joe Rogan:  
Check it out, The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day. All right, we’re rolling. Good to see you, sir. Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about—I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn’t play it because it could get copyright struck, and we don’t want to get the episode taken down. Sure, but it was the episode of you when you were on The View, and I think it was 2015 or 2016, like when you were running for president, right? You got introduced as our friend Donald Trump. That’s right. Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss, Joy Behar gives you a big hug, Barbara Walters gives you a big hug. They all loved you. They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you’re very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering, and then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working against you. Yeah, but there’s probably no one in history that I’ve ever seen that’s been attacked the way you’ve been attacked and the way they’ve done it so coordinated and systematically. When you see those same people in the past, very favorable to you, like Oprah—when you were on Oprah’s show, she was encouraging you. Last week, I did one of our last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday, that was a big deal being on Oprah’s show, the last one. I was like one of the last shows in that final week, and I said, “Boy, we’ve come a long way since then.” What was it like? Well, the concept was really like two different lives. You know, I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong; we had 12 seasons, and we had actually 14 seasons over that time. They canceled The Apprentice when you were running for president, correct? No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that, and I had enough of it. We did great; it was doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me; they said, “We’re going to give you a contract.” They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy, and they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, “You’re crazy, don’t run. Don’t run. Nobody gives up prime time.” They said, “You know, it’s one of those little things,” which is probably true—nobody gives up prime time for being president, for running against 20-some people. You know, it turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians. They said, “Who would do this?” I mean, it’s a long shot. Actually, the heads of NBC came over—Paul Telegdy, all the top people came over to see me, trying to talk me out of it because they wanted me to extend The Apprentice, which was doing well. So it was 14 seasons; it was 12 years. We had one or two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show. I said, “You know, I want to do this.” What happened is, previously, like three or four years before that, they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney, and somehow they put me in a poll, and I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn’t that hard, frankly, but I blew everybody away. I said, “That’s interesting,” because I never really gave it that much real thought. I thought about it, but never real thought. But I saw these polls were very good, and so I was thinking about doing it then. But I had a contract with The Apprentice, plus I was building two big buildings at the time, and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly. It was one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They’re very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that; I got them done. I had some very good successes, and I came on. Then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster, and I ran, and I won against Hillary. It was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you’re right. I was on The View many, many times, and they loved me. Just the way people would talk—I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn’t like you, there were always feuds and stuff like that. But the reality was, the thing turned on you when they found out that you were going to be president. It was very coordinated, and some people are catching on to that now. There are a lot of people that were longtime Democrats, like Elon and Bill Maher and all these different very intelligent people, and they support me now. Bill supports me; he’s been very supportive too. What I wanted to ask you was, what was it like when you actually got in? Nobody really can prepare you for that. When you’re running for president, you don’t really know what it’s going to be like when you actually get into office. What did you think it was going to be like in office? Or when I decided to run? No, when you got in. When I was in? When I was in the White House? Essentially, well, first of all, it was very surreal. You know, it’s very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn’t surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying, “You were hit all over the place,” because there was so much blood from the ear. You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, the ear bleeds a lot. Anyway, so I was thinking the other day, when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened. I said I wasn’t hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience. Okay, and what’s day one like? You win, you get inaugurated. Holy, I’m the president! Yeah, that’s what happened. So I’m driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I just built a building on Penn—you know the hotel, the old post office? We called it Trump National Hotel, and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria. It was a wonderful thing, but I’m driving down. I’m passing the hotel. You’ve never seen so many motorcycles, police, military. You know, it was a major thing. I got off—really, the first time I used Air Force One landed, and we’re coming down, and it was very big. I mean, it was incredible. We’re going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. You know, normally you’re used to going one way, and all of a sudden you’re going the other way. The street was loaded up, and I wanted to go out, and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn’t smart. You know, that’s a little bit dangerous, right? I mean, when you watch like Kennedy and some others, right? But I really felt—I don’t know—the love was so crazy. So I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do, and Melania got out with her beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. People loved it. Baron and I were walking down the street, but where it really got amazing was when we got to the White House. Now it’s a little bit before dark, beautiful, and we went up to the president’s quarters—they call them the presidential quarters—and I’m standing in this beautiful hallway. You know, it’s funny; nobody ever talks about the White House as being beautiful inside. You know, you think it’s going to be all metal doors and stuff. It’s not; it’s so beautiful.

[07:32 -> 14:59]  
Donald Trump:  
I made my money largely in luxury. The hallway is about 25 feet wide, and the ceiling heights are incredible. It's so beautiful. I was standing there and I said to the guys, "I want to see the Lincoln bedroom." I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom; I had only heard about it. I was standing with my wife and I said, "Can you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom!" It was amazing because, if you love the country, being in the Lincoln bedroom is something special. The bed, you know, he was very tall—he was 6'6", which would be like Barron, who is 6'9". He was very tall, and on top of that, he had a long, elongated bed because people were shorter back then. You see some of the chairs are very low to the ground. But he had the long bed, and they had the Gettysburg Address right there, the original version. I looked around and said, "Can you believe this?" Because I was never a politician. Even if you were a politician, I was never one. I just sort of started, and all of a sudden, I’m standing in the White House. It was a very surreal experience. That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. When I looked at the bed, I could see it was a little bit longer. He lost his son, and they suffered from melancholia. They didn’t call it depression; they called it melancholia, and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy, and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. On top of that, they lost their son, whose name was Tad. It was devastating. There was a little tiny picture of Tad, and you couldn’t see the details, just a little tiny picture of him. It was heartbreaking. He was in a war, and he was having a hard time because he couldn’t beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row, and Lincoln was getting a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about fight stuff, but I went to a UFC fight where there was a champion who was 14-1 about a year ago. You would know the names. He lost to this one guy, but the guy he was fighting was almost just an average fighter who had lost numerous times. I said, "Okay, I really don’t know who you’re talking about, but I’ll figure it out." The point is that he lost; he wasn’t nearly the fighter, but the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten him. He was the only guy who beat the champ five years before. I said, "I’ll take the guy that won the other fight," and that’s what happened. He beat him a second time. Sometimes, psychological advantage is a crazy thing. Lincoln had, I don’t know, I’ve never read this, but I heard it from people in the White House who really understood what was going on with Lincoln’s life. He had the yips, in a way, as golfers would say. He had a phobia about Robert E. Lee, saying, "I can’t beat Robert because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row." He was just beating the hell out of everyone. They tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, "No, I have to be with my state." His state was his whole thing, and he went to the South. I’ve had generals tell me—we have some great generals, the real generals, not the ones you see on television, but the ones who beat ISIS with me. We defeated ISIS in record time; it was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals, tough guys, not woke. But their favorite general, in terms of genius, was Robert E. Lee. Strategically, he took a war that should have been over in a few days and turned it into years of hell—a vicious war. So here I am, standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. I ran a number of months before I won. If you figured it out, it would be about a year or something like that. I had never run for office, and I did well. I went into debates; we had 18 people, including me, and then slowly but surely, they started to disappear. We had good debates; everyone’s aware of all this stuff. But what I want to get to is, what was the experience like once you got inside? What did you think it was going to be like in terms of your ability to govern? This was your first experience governing anything. You had never been a governor, never been a mayor—just private business. But now, all of a sudden, you’re inside the White House. The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed place. To me, it was beyond anything I could have imagined. That was the experience; it was surreal. With time, that wears off. It becomes your place where you stay. I was focused on two things: governing the country and survival. From the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden, they came down on me. Nobody has ever been treated that way. You see that in the Washington Post very early on; they said, "Well, now the impeachment stuff starts," and it did. It literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and running the nation. I had a combination that most people don’t have. What did you expect, though, in terms of once you got inside? You had to appoint all these people. How many appointments did you have to make? You actually have about 10,000 appointments. Now, they’re different; you have big ones, and then they appoint 100 people and 200 people. But the president is really involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. You’ll appoint a Secretary of State, and he or she will appoint a lot of people. So it’s a lot, but in terms of major ones, you probably have about 100. They’re big ones: Treasury, State, military. How did you know who to appoint? Well, I didn’t. I had no experience. You have to understand, I was there 17 times in Washington, and I never stayed over. According to the press, which I think is probably right, over the years, I was only there 17 times, and I never stayed over. Now I’m sitting there, and I’m saying, "This place is gorgeous," but I don’t know anybody. You know how it is; you go to certain areas, and in other areas, they may be great. Washington was great, but it’s not so great right now. We’ve got to fix it; we’ve got to make it better. It’s a very dangerous place, a very badly maintained place. We’re going to make it great; we’re going to make it better. We’re going to bring it back, but I wasn’t a Washington guy.
