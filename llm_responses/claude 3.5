[00:01 -> 14:59]
Joe Rogan:
The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. All right, we're rolling. Good to see you, sir.

One of the things I wanted to talk to you about was your appearance on The View. We decided not to play it due to potential copyright issues. It was from around 2015 or 2016 when you were running for president. Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, and Barbara Walters all gave you big hugs. They loved you and spoke very favorably about you, noting that while you might be conservative financially, you were socially liberal. The audience was cheering. But then you started winning in the polls, and the machine turned against you.

Donald Trump:
It was really like two different lives. I had a wonderful life with The Apprentice, which ran for 14 seasons over 12 years. When I decided to run, NBC wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett and the executives tried to talk me out of running, saying nobody gives up prime time television.

What happened was, a few years before, they did a poll with Mitt Romney and included me. I performed extremely well, which got me thinking about running. But I had The Apprentice contract and was building two big buildings at the time. I wanted to finish those projects and get my children involved in the business first.

Joe Rogan:
What was it like when you actually got into office? Nobody can really prepare you for that.

Donald Trump:
It was very surreal. When I got shot, that wasn't surreal - I knew exactly what was happening. But with the presidency, driving down Pennsylvania Avenue past my hotel, seeing all the motorcycles, police, and military - it was incredible. 

The White House itself was surprisingly beautiful inside. The hallways are 25 feet wide with high ceilings. Standing in the Lincoln Bedroom was amazing - seeing Lincoln's elongated bed because he was 6'6", the original Gettysburg Address, and the small picture of his son Tad who he lost. Lincoln and his wife suffered from what they called melancholia back then.

I had to focus on two things: governing the country and survival, because the attacks started immediately. The Washington Post was talking about impeachment before I even took office. As for appointments, the president is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments, though about 100 are major ones like Secretary of State and Treasury. Having only been to Washington 17 times before becoming president, I didn't know many people there.

I've never seen anyone attacked the way you've been attacked, especially considering how favorable people like Oprah were to you in the past.

Donald Trump:
It was really like two different lives. I had a wonderful life. The Apprentice was still going very strong - we had 14 seasons over 12 years. They canceled it when I was running for president. Actually, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it afterward. I was involved in that, but I had enough of it. The show was doing great, and they wanted me to stay. Mark Burnett and NBC executives came to try to talk me out of running, saying nobody gives up prime time television.

They were surprised I'd run against 18 professional politicians. Previously, about three or four years before, they did a poll with Mitt Romney where they included me, and I performed very well. That got me thinking about it, but I had The Apprentice contract and was building two big buildings at the time. Once those were finished and my kids were getting involved, I decided to run, and I won against Hillary.

[Continued discussion about Lincoln, the White House experience, and presidential appointments follows]

The conversation continues with Trump describing his initial experiences in the White House, discussing Lincoln's history, and explaining the challenges of making approximately 10,000 appointments as president, noting his limited prior experience in Washington with only 17 visits before becoming president.

## attempt #1 - Note: it cuts off due to asking for confirmation.

Intro Voice:
Joe Rogan podcast, check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

[00:11 -> 00:34]
Joe Rogan:
All right, we're rolling. Good to see you, sir. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about - I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get a copyright strike and we don't want to get the episode taken down - but it was the episode of you when you were on The View.

[00:34 -> 01:09]
Joe Rogan:
I think it was 2015 or '16, when you were running for president. You got introduced as "our friend Donald Trump." Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss, Joy Behar gives you a big hug, Barbara Walters gives you a big hug - they all loved you. They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light, the audience was cheering.

[01:12 -> 01:47]
Joe Rogan:
And then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working against you. There's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked, and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically. When you see those same people in the past very favorable to you, like Oprah - when you were on Oprah's show, she was encouraging you. Last week, I did one of her last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday. That was a big deal being on Oprah's show, one of the last ones in that final week.

[01:53 -> 02:31]
Donald Trump:
Well, it was really like two different lives. I had a wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons, and actually 14 seasons over 12 years. They had a couple of- well, they canceled The Apprentice when I was running for president.
